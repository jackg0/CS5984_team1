Due to the extensive damage those storms caused last year, the World Meteorological Organization's Region IV Hurricane Committee has officially retired these names. Storm names are retired if they were so deadly or destructive that the future use of the name would be insensitive. Otherwise lists of names are reused on a 6-year cycle. The committee also selected the replacement names for Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate with Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel respectively that will first appear in the 2023 list of storm names. Including these four additions, there have been 86 names retired from the Atlantic basin list since 1954, when storms began to be named. The 2005 hurricane season has the most retired names for one season. Five names were retired from that season, including Katrina and Rita. Hurricane Harvey became a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale before making landfall along the middle Texas coast on Aug. 25. The storm then stalled, with its center remaining over or near the Texas coast for four days, dropping historic rainfall amounts, of up to five feet, causing catastrophic flooding to the greater Houston area. Harvey is the second costliest hurricane in U.S. history (after inflation), behind only Katrina in 2005. At least 68 people died from the direct effects of the storm in Texas, the largest number in the state since 1919. Hurricane Irma was a long-lived hurricane that reached category 5 intensity on Sept. 5. The catastrophic hurricane made seven landfalls, four of which occurred as a category 5 hurricane across the northern Caribbean Islands. Irma made landfall as a category 4 hurricane in the Florida Keys on Sept. 10 and struck southwestern Florida as a category 3 the same day. Irma caused 44 direct deaths as a result of its strong winds, heavy rain and high surf. In the U.S., seven direct deaths were reported, and an additional 85 indirect deaths occurred, 80 of which were in Florida. Hundreds more were injured preparing for the storm, during it or in its aftermath. Hurricane Maria ravaged the island of Dominica as a category 5 on Sept. 19, and later devastated Puerto Rico as a high-end category 4 hurricane. It also inflicted serious damage on some of the other islands of the northeastern Caribbean Sea. Maria is the third costliest hurricane in U.S. history, behind Harvey and Katrina. Maria caused 31 direct deaths with 34 missing in Dominica, and two direct deaths in Guadeloupe. In Puerto Rico, the death toll stands at 65, which includes an unknown number of indirect deaths. Hurricane Nate crossed northeastern Nicaragua and eastern Honduras as a tropical storm, then made landfall on the northern Gulf Coast as a category 1 hurricane. It brought rainfall that caused significant impacts in Central America, where media reports indicate that these caused 44 deaths in the region. An additional nine people were missing in the region.

He writes for Houstonia Magazine and the Houston Press and usually joins us on Mondays to talk about developments in Houston sports. Every storm is different. Earlier today, Harris County Judge Ed Emmett expressed his concerns that many Houstonians will view future storms through the lens of Harvey, which did not make its landfall on Greater Houston. And Judge Emmett cautioned that every storm is different. But the site is still years away from being cleaned up. Backup generators, sitting just 2 feet above ground, were engulfed. Refrigeration systems ultimately failed, leading organic peroxides there to warm and destabilize. She mentioned relocating chemicals as a measure companies might use. Photo via Twitter Arkema Inc. The Federal Emergency Management Agency also provides daily updates. The federal government also maintained a centralized database to search for contracts awarded during the storm. But how the money has been spent is unclear. Abbott, who divided funding coordination among several state agencies, appointed a commission to help hard-hit cities, towns and counties get reimbursed by FEMA for public projects. Instead, local authorities are responsible for transparency and for holding onto receipts in case of a federal audit, said commission spokesman Laylan Copelin. Abbott spokesman Matt Hirsch said the state currently had no centralized, comprehensive funds tracker that would allow the public to monitor recovery and rebuilding spending. But how each agency spent the funds is unclear. When the money does arrive, it will be administered through the Texas General Land Office, which will publicize an accounting of each grant in quarterly reports hosted on its website. But removed from other recovery spending, the reports may have limited public utility. The HUD money will be for long-term rebuilding efforts, such as replacing a flooded water-treatment plant or building new homes. The funding, through community development block grants, is intended to fill in the gaps after individuals and government agencies exhaust all other sources of funding. Those databases were searchable by funding source, contract award and contractor. But that could change under legislation awaiting a vote in the House. The bill, the Disaster Recovery and Reform Act, aims to streamline data on the acquisition and administration of federal funds. The nonpartisan watchdog agency monitors how federal taxpayer money is spent. A lack of such transparency and oversight dogged federal agencies after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005.

The PREPS program helps neighbors with basic repairs to get them back into their houses. It doesn't cost homeowners a penny, but that's not why one neighbor is emotional. The homeowner asked us not to show her face or reveal her name. More than a week ago, work started on her home through the state's PREPS program. Crews started with the electrical meter, but once it was removed, they discovered the rest of the home's wiring needed to be redone. While the delay bothers her, what's most upsetting is what she hears from workers. The PREPS program is managed by the Texas General Land Office. RELATED: Texas Hurricane Harvey program leaves Houston family in tears for the wrong reason In order to do the job, the state hires contractors. The state requires companies to show proof of insurance. While they vet contractors, they don't check sub-contractors. Officials say their performance falls on the contractor, which can impact future assignments. As for this Houston job, the state says the amount electrical work wasn't included in the original plan. Now, the contractor is paying for the work. He also put the family in a hotel for a couple days. While the homeowner appreciates the help, she's frustrated over how long it's taking and the people hired to do the job. The state said it reviews contractors' performances weekly. Eyewitness News also wants to learn more about their performances. We've requested complaints filed against crews in this program. The state said it wants to hear from upset homeowners. It created a hotline for people to call at 1-888-610-1622. There's also been confusion over what repairs the PREPS program covers.

The flood control district in the Houston area is considering a proposal to build massive underground tunnels to drain floodwaters from bayous across the county. Republican Rep. John Culberson of Houston said this project could be partially funded by Federal Emergency Management Agency hazard mitigation grants. Commissioners will vote Tuesday, March 27, on whether to pursue a feasibility study to assess the tunnel proposal. Houston Matters examines the lessons learned after the storm. Over the course of the ensuing several days, the Greater Houston area saw unprecedented flooding that displaced thousands of residents and caused over billions in damages across the state. Trump and Karen Pence, the wife of Vice President Mike Pence, flew to Corpus Christi on Wednesday. Both posed for photos with emergency staff and military personnel who responded after Harvey barreled ashore in South Texas on Aug. 25. Texas first lady Cecilia Abbott and Land Commissioner George P. Bush took part in the visit that included a stop in nearby Rockport, where Harvey decimated hundreds of homes and businesses. President Trump and the first lady traveled to the Houston area just days after Harvey made landfall to also comfort victims and thank emergency personnel.

The poll is another indication of how families along the Texas coast continue struggling in wake of the Category 4 storm, which left Houston underwater and killed more than 80 people. MORE: Houston Matters Discusses Harvey Survey With Elena Marks of Episcopal Health Trump, who has consistently low approval ratings nationally, also received worse numbers than Congress or Texas leaders for their response to Harvey, with half saying the president was doing a fair or poor job. Fears over immigration enforcement may also have a chilling effect on asking for help: Of those surveyed who were likely to be in the U.S. illegally, a majority were either very or somewhat worried about drawing attention to their status if they reached out for help. African-American residents and those living well below the federal poverty level were most likely to say they needed more help. Applying for disaster assistance and repairing damaged homes were the biggest concerns to those needing help, followed by finding affordable housing and getting medical care. About 4 in 10 were also not confident about Harvey relief dollars trickling down to those who need it most. More than 892,000 have applied for aid with the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the aftermath of Harvey slamming the Texas coast on Aug. 25. About one-third of those applicants were deemed ineligible, and FEMA spokesman Robert Howard said every person who is denied aid receives a letter stating the reason and information on the appeals process. The survey of 1,635 adults was conducted by phone Oct. 17-Nov. 20 using a random sample of residents that suffered large amounts of property damage from Harvey, according to FEMA reports. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.0 percentage points.  Alonso Guillen, 31, died in Hurricane Harvey.

Alonso Guillen, a 31-year-old disc jockey from Lufkin, disappeared on Wednesday around midnight along with two friends after their boat hit the bridge over the creek and capsized. One of them was rescued after clinging to a tree in the rushing water, but days later, after the rains let up and the creek level receded, Guillen and Tomas Carreon Jr. were still missing. Searchers spotted Carreon's body floating down the wide, swift-moving creek on Friday around 1 p.m. On Sunday afternoon, Guillen's body floated past a sandy berm where family members had been keeping watch for days, staring out at the murky water. A relative dove in and pulled him to the shoulder of the creek until they were able to bring a boat over to get him onto shore. Media: Chron.com and the Houston Chronicle Guillen's father, Jesus Guillen, said he'd asked his son not to try and rescue people in the storm, but he insisted, saying he wanted to help people. He cried and prayed on Sunday afternoon as they pulled his son's body from the water. The recovery of his body brings the number of people who have died or are feared dead from Harvey to nearly 60, and officials warn that more could be found. Guillen, who was born in Piedras Negras, Mexico, and moved to Lufkin as a teenager, headed south with his friends toward Houston after Hurricane Harvey, towing a borrowed boat. They were near Interstate 45 and Beltway 8 and trying to reach an apartment complex when they hit the bridge, relatives said. Alonso Guillen was a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which temporarily lifted the threat of deportation for immigrants brought to the U.S. before they were 16, family members said. His father is a lawful permanent, but his mother is still in the application process for legal status. Reached at her home in Piedras Negras, Mexico, across the border from Eagle Pass, Rita Ruiz de Guillen, 62, said she is heartbroken. Jennifer Gabris, a CBP spokeswoman, said in a statement Tuesday that the agency has no record of Ruiz de Guillen applying for admission to the United States this year. She said CBP has worked with the Mexican Consulate this week to help the mother attend her son's funeral. The agency granted her request for humanitarian parole late Monday night. Lindsay Ellis contributed to this report. Her home was flooded by Hurricane Harvey. Allen said health professionals are seeing more patients reporting trauma related to Harvey and its aftermath. Daily life can be a struggle. Mental health issues are often under-reported because symptoms typically are not expressed for weeks or months after a traumatic event. That was cold comfort to some city council members, who saw projects in their districts delayed as a result. The only way we can fund the Harvey recovery project is to take it from the existing CIP.

You can see the problem from your car. Houston is a sprawling web of strip malls and 10-lane freeways. Hydrologist Jeff East stands under one of those freeways, beneath an overpass and above the east fork of the San Jacinto River. The river is more like a trickling stream, 20 feet below. But East points to a line of seeds and debris in the grass by the highway. Debris left at the high-water mark is like a bathtub ring around Harris County. Along with gauges in the San Jacinto River, it shows flood levels never seen before. Disaster downstream The San Jacinto is a perfect example of what went wrong. The San Jacinto is just one of many streams and rivers that flow into Houston. The city is kind of like a drain in a huge bathtub. People have known that for years. In the 1940s, after huge floods, the city tried to stop the water before it reached Houston. Engineers built two reservoirs, called Addicks and Barker. Richard Hyde used to live near Addicks reservoir. He says that during Harvey, his house filled up fast. He got out when it reached the electrical outlets in his house. That pushes more water into Houston. Years ago, there was talk of building a third reservoir. Engineers opened spillways and water shot downstream toward the city through concrete-lined bayous. Runoff from paved roads and neighborhoods ran into the bayous as well. One of those, Brays Bayou, flooded a neighborhood called Meyerland. Ruined drywall and carpeting remains piled on the sidewalks. Most of the furniture is gone. They say Harvey was the worst flood by far. Mary Wilkins blames overdevelopment outside the city. Officials are now talking about building that third reservoir and demolishing houses that repeatedly flood. He says the city needs more radical changes, like requiring new homes to be built 3 feet above flood level. Copyright 2017 NPR.

The campaign, One America Appeal, began with a public service announcement featuring the presidents during the first N.F.L. game of the season on Thursday night. The appeal was a rare showing of unity in American politics, and President Trump, who has disregarded traditional presidential decorum and has criticized some of his predecessors, endorsed their effort. One America Appeal CreditVideo by One America Appeal The fund-raising effort is focused on people affected by Hurricane Harvey, the destructive storm that dumped more than 50 inches of rain in parts of southeast Texas and caused billions of dollars in damages and lost economic activity. The state is of particular importance for President Bush, who was governor there in the 1990s, and his father, President George Bush, who lives part of the year in Houston. The campaign is expected to expand to help those hurt by Irma. That storm, an enormous Category 5 hurricane churning through the Caribbean, is forecast to turn toward South Florida over the next day and then strike Georgia, where former President Jimmy Carter lives. The presidents have a history of coming together to help victims of natural disasters. President Bill Clinton teamed up with the man he defeated in the 1992 presidential election, George Bush, to raise money after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005.

CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York Times Rockport is known for its duck hunting and its expert fishing guides. It was named for the rock ledge under its shore, and like its name, its people are the solid sort, not easily moved by much, including the threat of hurricanes. On Sunday morning, a resident of Glass Avenue grabbed armfuls of fallen tree limbs that dared to make a mess of his street. No one elected Mr. Thornton, 67. With a pocketknife in a holster on his belt, dressed in bluejeans, a sleeveless muscle shirt and a camouflage cap, Mr. Thornton was more rural than coastal at heart, much like his town.

The hurricane ripped off the roof of a house just four doors down from Mr. Thornton. National Guard and Coast Guard helicopters flew low overhead. Neighbors returning to their homes hugged Mr. Thornton when they saw him on the street. Mr. Thornton was at once surly and sweet. Moments after he kicked away tree debris, frustrated at the damage done to the street he loves, he saw a wounded bird amid the broken branches. He called to it with his arms out, trying to soothe it.

Towards the end of the press conference, the mayor stressed he is especially sensitive about the situation of Harvey victims who are seniors and families that have already exhausted their savings. The goal of the program is to accumulate two million volunteer hours in one year by engaging and recruiting volunteers, and connecting them to agencies and organizations that are providing relief and recovery services to residents across the city. According to Turner, the program will allow the City to more accurately report volunteer hours for Harvey related relief and recovery activities and ensure the maximum volunteer offset for FEMA match requirements. City Council members Dave Martin (District E), Jack Christie (At-Large 5), Karla Cisneros (District H) and David Robinson (At-Large 2) were also present at the press conference.

But officials and nonprofit groups say more funding will be needed to help the state rebuild and reach those who live in the shadows and might not have easy access to resources to assist in their recovery. After several extensions, FEMA had set Thursday as the deadline for Texans affected by Harvey to register for federal help. By registering, residents will be eligible for a variety of assistance, including temporary housing and repair or replacement of damaged homes. Only residents in the 41 Texas counties included in the federal disaster declaration were eligible to apply. Harvey made landfall as a Category 4 storm on Aug. 25 about 180 miles (290 kilometers) southwest of Houston. It damaged or destroyed around 200,000 homes and flooded much of Houston and smaller coastal communities with record amounts of rain and high winds. Many residents remain displaced, with nearly 40,000 people still living in hotels paid for by FEMA. Not everyone who needs help after Harvey applied with FEMA, as many people, including low income individuals and immigrants, might not have known to apply, said Elena Marks, president and CEO of Episcopal Health Foundation, a Houston-based nonprofit. The foundation is hoping to help agencies reach these individuals with an analysis it did last month of assistance applications submitted to FEMA that identifies the zip codes in the 41 counties in the federal disaster declaration that submitted the most applications. The analysis found the zip codes with the most applications were spread out across Southeast Texas and included areas of Port Arthur, Houston and its suburb of Dickinson and Rockport, near where Harvey made landfall.

Now, more than a month after the storm made landfall, parents may have noticed changes in their children's behavior. Some kids may be more clingy than before. Others may seem withdrawn. Some may be afraid of the rain, while others may beg their parents to avoid their recently flooded neighborhoods. Dr. Julie Kaplow founded the Trauma and Grief Center at the University of Michigan in 2012 before moving it to the University of Texas Medical School at Houston in 2014, and then to the Texas Children's Hospital in August, before Harvey struck. The center will open the Harvey Resiliency and Recovery Program in early October to provide risk screenings, assessments and help to children ages 7 to 17 who are at high risk of developing PTSD after the storm. The new program was funded in part by Children's Health Fund, through a donation by singer-songwriter Paul Simon, who co-founded the organization, and his wife, singer and Texas-native Edie Brickell.. Kaplow spoke with the Houston Chronicle on Thursday about children and post-traumatic stress, symptoms of stress disorders and how teachers can identify stress-related issues in their students. A: I would say after about six weeks, start looking for signs or symptoms of PTSD: hyper-vigilance; if they're very jumpy or nervous at even smaller sounds; re-experiencing; having nightmares or feeling like they're right back in the situation; avoidance, not wanting to talk or think about what happened; going out of their way to avoid things that remind them of what happened; not wanting to go near their old neighborhood where everything was demolished. That is normal. There can also be depressive issues that come with moving to a new school or a new home. There can be some sleeping issues where your child will want to sleep with you more or may have issues falling asleep. That is all very normal and may not necessarily require thorough intervention. But if these problems are impairing the child's everyday activities, they may need a more thorough evaluation. A: Most children who experience a storm or flooding will not develop PTSD. It's most likely to develop if they've had a prior history of trauma or prior histories of loss - like the loss of loved ones - or if they have a preexisting mental health condition. Post-traumatic stress really is not very common, and most children are resilient in the aftermath of something like that. (Dr. A: Often times we see children who have PTSD are often diagnosed or misdiagnosed with ADHD, partly because both disorders manifest behaviorally in very similar ways. Hyper-vigilance can look a lot like hyper-activity. The fear and anxiety in the brain triggers the flight-or-fight syndrome, while what's being shown in children physically is fidgeting. They can't sit still, they can't make eye contact with the teacher. A: Look out for signs that the child's functioning is impaired. If you're seeing children unable to complete homework, coming to school looking exhausting or disheveled, not able to focus during the day, getting into more arguments with their peers, they may be socially isolating themselves. Facebook Twitter Email More Messenger SMS LinkedIn Reddit Pinterest Comments Print Shelby Webb Shelby Webb is a suburban education reporter for the Houston Chronicle, covering trends across districts in Harris, Fort Bend, Montgomery and Brazoria counties. She previously worked as an education reporter with the Sarasota Herald-Tribune in Florida from 2013 to 2016 and attended the University of Florida.   For Donna Wotkyns, a licensed social worker in Houston, that reaction shows exactly why ramping up resources for long-term mental health services for Texas students is necessary. Experts from the nonprofit Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute will serve as consultants for the task force. With thousands of families displaced from flooded homes and pushed deeper into poverty, more students will need help processing their trauma for many months to come. Mental health experts and counselors said the effects of the trauma would probably last for years. Many students in these regions were already living with other trauma, such as abuse in the home or other types of violence, Saxton said. Once these students are back in school, after the immediate response to the disaster, they are more likely to act out and get in trouble in the classroom, unable to focus on their learning, she said. Schools need to train administrators and teachers to look past the immediate behaviors and address the underlying trauma, instead of suspending or expelling students. More schools are making it easier for students to regularly access counselors and social workers, running support groups or providing one-on-one counseling in partnership with community groups, Saxton said. The Legislature did not pass a bill this spring that would have required educators to get training on how to teach students with mental health conditions and how trauma affects student behavior. But individual school districts, including Houston ISD, have pursued this type of teacher training on their own. That was cold comfort to some city council members, who saw projects in their districts delayed as a result.

Additional information from other agencies will be added as it is provided to the commission, the statement said. The AP reported in December that the absence of such a tool could hinder coordination and encourage fraud. Abbott spokesman Matt Hirsch said in December that a funds tracker was in the works, but did not know what it would entail or when it would come online. After Harvey hammered Texas last August, Abbott pledged that the state would lead its own recovery, streamlining federal aid to storm victims while avoiding the inefficiencies of earlier Washington-controlled disaster responses. Abbott tapped A&M chancellor John Sharp to oversee the commission, and put Land Commissioner George P. Bush in charge of short- and long-term housing. About 900,000 later applied for government recovery assistance. Federal records revealed it took nearly four times as long to house people in trailers after Harvey as it did following Hurricane Katrina, whose chaotic aftermath became a national scandal.

Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush said Wednesday current regulations and protocols from the federal government are slowing down the recovery after Hurricane Harvey. During a hearing held in Beaumont, Bush testified before the Texas House Committee on Urban Affairs. Bush enumerated several current guidelines that, in his opinion, are causing difficulty for Harvey victims. One of them is the fact that, in order to receive certain financial assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Harvey victims have to apply for loans granted through the Small Business Administration (SBA). This happens regardless of the fact the person owns or not a small business because one of the tasks of the SBA is distributing disaster recovery funds. Transtar has released an updated list of road closures due to flooding. Hurricane Harvey caused catastrophic damage in Houston, but the historic deluge also brought calamity to the Houston Ship Channel and Galveston Bay. On either side of the channel are grain silos, warehouses and storage tanks for products ranging from petroleum to molasses. Giant container ships refuel for their voyages back across the Atlantic Ocean. Tugboats are nudging rusty barges in every direction. The term means that the channel is too shallow for ship traffic in certain places. A boat dredges the ship channel on the Port of Houston. Due to the flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey, massive amounts of dredging are needed to get the ship channel back to a normal operating state. The Port of Houston ranks as the busiest port in the nation, and first in foreign waterborne tonnage. It serves the largest petrochemical complex in America. But these shoals created by Harvey mean that cargo-laden ships run the risk of running aground because they sit so low in the water. Enter the dredges. Ever since, nature has been trying to fill it back in. The dredges have to maintain the channel at a depth of 45 feet for the deep-draft ships delivering Volkswagens, wind turbine blades and other heavy cargo to the seaport. A landfill used by The Port of Houston to dump material dredged from the ship channel after Hurricane Harvey. Every year for the past three years, huge floods in Houston have forced emergency dredging. In fact, the workboats were still scooping up silt from earlier storms when Harvey struck. With more monster storms hitting Houston, the port lobbies Congress to give the Corps additional funding to maintain the ship channel. Campbell concedes they could use more dredges.

On the ground, it came sweeping in from the Katy Prairie some 30 miles west of downtown. Mexico City, Parched and Sinking, Faces a Water Crisis Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor. Water drains naturally in this stretch of Texas, or at least it used to. At more than 600 square miles, Houston has grown to be as big as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia combined, a giant spread of asphalt smothering many of the floodplains that once shuttled water from the prairies to the sea. When finished, the newest road to ring the city and propel its expansion, called the Grand Parkway, will encircle an area equivalent to all of Rhode Island. For years, the local authorities turned a blind eye to runaway development. Thousands of homes have been built next to, and even inside, the boundaries of the two big reservoirs devised by the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1940s after devastating floods. Back then, Houston was 20 miles downstream, its population 400,000. Today, these reservoirs are smack in the middle of an urban agglomeration of six million. We have bridged the continent with railways and roads, erected cities in the desert, and changed the course of rivers. Built on a mosquito-infested Texas swamp, Houston similarly willed itself into a great city. Its sprawl of highways and single-family homes is a postwar version of the American dream. Unfortunately, nature always gets the last word. The very forces that pushed the city forward are threatening its way of life. Sprawl is only part of the story. Houston is also built on an upbeat, pro-business strategy of low taxes and little government. Many Texans regard this as the key to prosperity, an antidote to Washington. It encapsulates a potent vision of an unfettered America. Harvey called that concept into question. It may have been an unusually bad hurricane, dumping trillions of gallons of water in a few days, even more to the east of the city than to the west, in the prairie, and setting all kinds of records. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Cypress Creek Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Buffalo Bayou Barker Reservoir Buildings Damaged by Hurricane Harvey Brays Bayou Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Buildings Damaged By Hurricane Harvey Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Barker Reservoir Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Cypress Creek Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Barker Reservoir Buffalo Bayou Brays Bayou Buildings Damaged By Hurricane Harvey Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. Global warming may not specifically have caused Harvey, any more than a single major league home run can be attributed to steroids. That said, scientists have little doubt that climate change is making storms worse and more frequent. Coming right after those events, Harvey has led even some pro-development enthusiasts to rethink the city and its surroundings. Mexico City, Parched and Sinking, Faces a Water Crisis Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point. Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor. A self-described traditional Republican and big backer of the Grand Parkway, Judge Emmett had planned on spending his twilight years in public service saving the Houston Astrodome from demolition. Harvey altered that. Now he thinks his mission is to protect the entire region. After every natural calamity, American politicians make big promises. They say: We will rebuild. We will not be defeated. Never again will we be caught unprepared. But they rarely tackle the toughest obstacles. Resettling neighborhoods, making certain places off-limits to development, creating dikes and reservoirs is difficult, both financially and politically. It takes longer than most election cycles. Memories fade. Inertia sets in. Residents just want to get their lives back to normal. Politicians want votes, not trouble. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans, for better and worse, used its cataclysm as an opportunity to reboot, not just fixing levees but overhauling public schools, hospitals and many neighborhoods. It was a wrenching process. The mere suggestion of moving people out of vulnerable neighborhoods set off bitter protests, causing the city to back down from some of its most sweeping proposals. Texas after Harvey is no different, and perhaps even less prepared to change. Like the rest of America, it is deeply divided between urban and rural, Democrat and Republican. Houston is a blue city with a black mayor in a bright red state. Ultimately, though, any resolution will require that everyone face the same threats together. The spread of asphalt and concrete has inhibited rainwater from draining naturally in Houston. When finished, the Grand Parkway, above, on the edge of Houston, will encircle an area equivalent to all of Rhode Island. He remembers escaping years ago to the prairie to bird watch. One recent morning he drove me out there along the Grand Parkway and pulled into an unfinished subdivision. The development, she said, adheres to county standards requiring that houses be raised above the 100-year floodplain. The woman handed Mr. Blackburn a glossy brochure and a disclaimer, which he scanned before climbing back into the car, shaking his head. The disclaimer explained that roads outside the development, linking it to the parkway, occupy the 10-year floodplain, meaning they would have about a 10 percent chance of flooding every year. But that requires politicians to agree. An upbeat narrative casts business-friendly Texas in the loner role of swashbuckling cowboy, disdainful of coastal elites. He believes cities are the culprit. For years, Texas Republicans promoted local controls to push against federal court orders on issues like desegregation and same-sex marriage. Now state leaders have made a U-turn. Little wonder, post-Harvey, that state and local officials have anointed different flood and recovery czars. Texas is sounding these days like Russia under the Romanovs. The system ensures nobody is clearly in charge. Least of all in Houston. Two other bills to study flooding in the Houston region, introduced in the last legislative session, died in committee. I met with the mayor in City Hall at the time. He noted that the Legislature had convened a special session to ban gender-neutral bathrooms. Another official, this one with the county, made the point that the area around Houston is a patchwork of counties and municipalities with different rules and no coordination because Texans believed the upside of what became, in essence, institutionalized entropy was that it allowed residents to avoid the encumbrances of city governments, regulations and taxes. The problem is that hurricanes and floods, worsened by climate change, do not recognize political borders or county lines. Their toll is shared by everyone. The hypocrisy of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, resisting federal aid to the New York region after Hurricane Sandy but then requesting it for Texas after Harvey, is in fact part of this same history. Bruce Hooper, outside his home in Kashmere Gardens in Houston, would like to move but has no place to go. Before it elected Mr. Turner, it elected a mayor who was a lesbian. The city is in thrall to cars and highways and has precious little mass transit, but the municipality of Houston relies more on renewable energy than any other big city in America. Houston has more green space, relative to paved, than New York. They insist that its business-friendly, light-on-regulations approach helps account for a big rise in employment since 2000. Decades later, Houston boasts of becoming the most diverse big city in the country, with comparatively low housing costs that translate to higher levels of minority homeownership. Harris County officials say they have received as many requests for buyouts since the hurricane (3,000) as there have been buyouts since the mid-1990s. Harvey turned out to be an equal opportunity disaster. They are among the homeowners hoping for a buyout. Buying out rich homes to repurpose vulnerable areas like Meyerland for flood detention, as Mr. Sacks notes, would require loads of money and remove valuable properties from tax rolls in a county that relies on property taxes. Bruce Hooper would move, too. During Harvey, he woke up to crackling sounds, when floodwaters started to seep into his appliances and electrical outlets. Mr. Hooper lives in a poor area called Kashmere Gardens. I found him sitting on a tattered lawn chair outside the shell of his tumbledown rental. An unemployed former parks employee, Mr. Hooper told me that he and his family of five had to be airlifted out by the Coast Guard after a detention pond overflowed and water inside the house rose from ankle to chest high in an hour. The Kahans own a single-story home in a middle-class neighborhood, Bear Creek Village. Christine Kahan and her husband had lived for 28 years in their house without a flood. Now Ms. Kahan said she would entertain a buyout. A part-time real-estate agent, she advises clients to think twice about buying any home that flooded. Hers is now one of them. But Mr. Kahan says they will stay, for the time being. I asked how that lined up with his desire not to leave Bear Creek. One afternoon I biked with Guy Hagstette around Buffalo Bayou Park. The Allen brothers were real estate swindlers from New York who founded Houston in 1836. After oil turned up beneath the muck and clay, they seemed like prophets. It collapsed riverbanks and left dunes of silt that buried pedestrian paths, playgrounds and fields. He meant not just repairing and fortifying the park, but also adapting Houston to the new normal. For starters, that will require fresh numbers. Harris County demands that new developments retain enough rainwater on site to neutralize the effects of a 100-year storm. But those 100-year numbers date back years. They are based on mitigating a storm that averages 13.2 inches of rain in 24 hours. Harvey brought 25.9 inches in 24 hours. The Memorial Day flood dropped 11 inches in three hours. The Tax Day flood dumped 17 inches in 12 hours in the Katy Prairie. As meteorologist for the Harris County Flood Control District, Mr. Lindner spent five sleepless days and nights during Harvey as an unshakable, tousled expert in a blue, button-down shirt, going on television and providing Houstonians with useful information. We met at the flood control district office one morning. Mr. Blackburn tells a story about a local hero, Jesse Jones, the former secretary of commerce, who helped secure federal funds for the ship channel. In 1929, Mr. Jones convinced fellow Houston bankers to put aside reserves of cash that prevented city banks from failing in the Depression. What may save Houston today, Mr. Blackburn said, is another common-sense strategy involving stricter controls and infrastructural investments that somehow lets state Republicans acquiesce behind closed doors but beat their chests in public. A hurricane that pushes a massive storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico into Galveston Bay, up the ship channel, could overwhelm refineries and unleash a toxic tsunami, killing many and rattling the national economy. The judge and mayor are among those talking about a so-called Ike Dike, named after Hurricane Ike in 2008, which killed dozens in Texas. It would be a massive sea-gate that could block a surge. The scale and engineering would be Texas-size. The cost would be, too. Judge Emmett asked, rhetorically, when we met in his office. Urban sprawl is only part of the story of Houston. The city was also built on an upbeat, pro-business strategy of low taxes and little government. Map by Ford Fessenden. Source: FEMA preliminary damage estimates. We would love to hear from you.

Clear Lake City was annexed by the city of Houston in 1977 but the area retained the Clear Lake City Water Authority. When its owners wanted to sell the old golf course, the water authority proposed buying the greenway and transforming it into a detention pond to cut down on future flooding. That mix of more concrete and stronger storms raised concerns the area could soon see the type of catastrophic flooding West Houston experienced during Harvey. Not everyone is sold on the project. The money would be better spent improving drainage lines and buying out homes prone to flooding, she said. Soon after Harvey, she saw Branch, the water authority official, at church. The West Houston Association has added another regional voice to call for federal, state, and local funding to be dedicated to future flood mitigation projects in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Chairman John Moody and executive director Auggie Campbell hope funds can be directed to projects that fund, among other things, home buyouts. We talk with both of them about their suggested flood mitigation plans going forward and where funding for such projects should come from. But the cost is out of reach for many families. Paul Takahashi from the Houston Business Journal joins Houston Matters to answer that and other questions. There are dozens of deed-restricted communities in Houston, which rely on homeowners associations to serve the best interests of the community at large. Floodwaters spoiled medicines. He went 11 days without his medicine. Angelia Soloman watched out the window of her ranch house in northeast Houston as the flood waters rose up to the window sills. She huddled inside with her three adopted children (ages 12 to 15), a nephew and her 68-year-old mother. When the water began rushing under the front door, filling up the house like a bathtub, Soloman led her family outside, and plunged into a river of water up to her chest. She had used her last unemployment check to buy school clothes and supplies that now faced certain ruin in the floodwaters. We just lost everything. The destruction included her HIV medication. When I met Soloman in Houston, it had been a month since she took her last HIV pill. Many Houstonians with HIV faced similar problems. Floodwaters ruined medicines. As the days ticked on, many worried the amount of HIV in their blood would increase and become resistant to treatment. Donnall Walker waited out the storm with his twelve brothers and sisters outside of Houston. The 52-year-old former fashion designer left his HIV medication behind. A week later, when he finally returned, everything inside was ruined. Walker went to his pharmacy the day it reopened, but he went nearly two weeks without his HIV drugs. There are some 25,000 people with HIV and AIDS living Houston and Harris County. Angelia Soloman, the single mother who waded through the waters with her family, finally found a ride to the county clinic to refill her HIV prescription. There is still too much to do.

An estimated 1 trillion gallons of water fell during the four days that Harvey stalled over Harris County. DEATHS: At least 72 fatalities have been attributed to Harvey. AREA AFFECTED: The Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved individual assistance for residents affected by Harvey in 39 counties in southern Texas, with 35 reporting sustaining damage. Some counties may not yet have reported damage. In Harris County, where Houston is located, officials estimate that at least 136,000 homes were damaged. PEOPLE IN SHELTERS: At the height of Harvey, more than 34,500 people were housed in shelters throughout Texas. In Houston, the George R. Brown Convention Center housed more than 10,000 at one point. Currently, more than 21,200 people are in shelters, including more than 9,200 in the Dallas area. RESCUES: State and federal agencies conducted more than 122,300 rescues and evacuations. Those included more than 34,000 by the Texas National Guard and other state military forces and more than 11,000 by the U.S. Coast Guard. In Houston, the police department helped perform more than 5,000 water rescues. FEMA AID: More than 660,200 individuals have applied for federal assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The sewage-like stench chased the couple indoors and Sanchez, sick to her stomach, lay down. Petrochemical corridor residents say air that is bad enough on normal days got worse as Harvey crashed into Houston and then yielded the highest ozone pollution so far this year anywhere in Texas. The Houston metro area was ranked 12th in the nation for worst ozone pollution by The American Lung Association this year, although its air was better than the Los Angeles and New York regions. Plants owned by Shell, Chevron, Exxon-Mobil and other industry giants reported more than 1.5 million pounds (680 metric tons) of extraordinary emissions over eight days beginning Aug. 23 to the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality in Harris County, which encompasses Houston. Of the known carcinogens released during Harvey, more than 13 tons were benzene. Inhaling it can cause dizziness and even unconsciousness and long-term exposure can trigger leukemia. The federal Environmental Protection Agency issued a similar statement. At an Arkema Inc. plant about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of downtown Houston, organic peroxides rendered unstable by lost refrigeration exploded in flames and cast an acrid plume. At least 18 tons burned after people within a 1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) radius were evacuated. A city health department air monitor downwind of the refinery on Friday registered an alarming level of up to 14,000 parts per billion of volatile organic compounds, some carcinogenic, said department chief scientist Loren Raun, and aerial monitoring continued to detect benzene on Monday. Exxon Mobil is appealing. The other two companies paid, said Philip Hilder, attorney for the environmental groups. The air reeked of natural gas, he said, driving him and his friends inside. As the storm closed in, Gov. Greg Abbott decreed the temporary suspension of emissions regulations. People in the petrochemical corridor should be provided health screening as a next step in Harvey recovery, said Rotkin-Ellman of the environmental group NRDC. A Harris County pollution control services toxicologist, Latrice Babin, said she was not aware of any special screening. Nor had the sickening smell, she said. She wants to see a doctor, but like many in her neighborhood, she said, Sanchez currently has no health insurance. Harvey has only increased the urgency. Officials have renewed talks about building another reservoir. When they reached capacity, thousands of homes were flooded by water released from them. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, wants a third reservoir built as soon as possible. The SSPEED Center, a storm research institute at Rice University, has been looking into this issue too. Bedient said, besides a third or even fourth reservoir, we need more detention basins. Those could be put in bought out areas and golf courses, for example. He said there needs to be a policy change to address unchecked development and land use. Matthew Zeve, director of operations the Harris County Flood Control District, disagrees with that last part. He said there are already drainage requirements for new development. Zeve does agree that more detention is needed across the area. Detention basins are dug into the ground. They detain, or keep, stormwater and slowly release it into a channel and eventually Galveston Bay, Zeve said. Reservoirs are above the ground behind raised embankments. But he said it may have helped getting additional funds from federal, state and local government. On the city level, a new taskforce will be looking into future flood mitigation. That includes the city, county, state and federal government. He suggests bringing all of these governmental entities into one management agency to deal entirely with flooding in the region.

We find out what they mean. And some local teachers share stories from their time in the classroom. Almost three months have passed since Yashica Foster watched her Houston townhome flooded by Hurricane Harvey on TV. Foster, her husband Raymond and their three kids had rushed out in time to escape the 17 feet of water that ultimately invaded the complex. They had already started looking for a place after FEMA announced it would end the hotel program on Nov. 27, then last week the agency extended the deadline to Jan. 16. Keene assumed her flood insurance would cover the rent, like it did during Tropical Storm Allison 16 years earlier, but she was wrong. Foster and her family are among the more than 47,000 people still living in hotels paid for by FEMA, while Keene is among the more than 90,000 people who have filed insurance claims through the National Flood Insurance Program, also managed by FEMA. But the number of Texans who need help with housing is likely much higher. Neither FEMA nor the state of Texas know exactly how many homes were damaged by Harvey or how many residents remain scattered around the state, living with family or friends, in hotel rooms, in rentals, or even in their cars. With their routines disrupted, thousands of renters and homeowners now face a harrowing path to a permanent housing solution. For many, the long process of waiting for insurance inspections, government assistance and home repairs is just getting started. Many could be stuck in temporary housing for months or years. It feels weird and uncomfortable, she says, but the worst part is that two of her three children are not there. Every day she and her husband, who drives a delivery truck, wake up at 5:45 a.m. to start an 86-mile journey to pick up and drop off each family member at school or work. The Fosters have been at the Greenspoint Marriott for almost a month. A lavender candle burns on the night stand, a bouquet of red and yellow roses sits is in front of the TV, and the top of the mini-bar is packed with snacks. On the floor sits the carry-on sized suitcase they packed in a rush as the floodwaters rose. Yashica Foster knew it was time to go when the water reached her ankles. They grabbed an old photo album and some clothes and rushed out of their townhouse. It was the right call. The family lost almost everything they owned and the townhome will soon be torn down. Their application for property damage assistance is still pending. The couple, who were highschool sweethearts, spent years building a life for their family. In addition to the hotel voucher program, FEMA has also provided rental assistance for one or more months to almost 134,000 Texans displaced by Harvey. Anyone who applied for immediate assistance through FEMA will automatically be considered for these programs. Maria Keene in the high rise apartment she and her husband and two daughters have rented in Houston on Oct. 26, 2017. For homeowners, the situation is also complicated. She is already meeting with builders to get estimates and evaluate her possibilities. Rebuilding an elevated house would be a safer but much more expensive solution. They could also buy a townhome or rent an apartment and sell the house for less than what they paid for it. Rebuilding is going to be a long process for a lot of people, according to Scott Norman, executive director of the Texas Association of Builders. Thousands of people need to repair their homes and contractors are booked for months, if not years. The association estimates that the Texas building market was short 250,000 workers before the storm. Harvey might have added the need for another 100,000 workers. Wages and material costs are also going up due to the high demand, he said. she said.

The entire metro Houston area averaged between three and four feet of rain. Harvey was the first of three monster storms to hit the United States in 2017. Tallies on Irma and Maria are still being compiled. All but three of the deaths were from freshwater flooding. The maximum winds on landfall were 133 miles per hour (213 kilometers per hour) making it a Category 5 storm. But the really big numbers in the report have to do with rain. Government meteorologists calculated that much of the Houston metro area experienced a flood that is a greater than once-in-1,000 year event, the highest level they calculate. Until Harvey, the record for rainfall from a hurricane or tropical storm in the Lower 48 states was 48 inches in 1978, and 52 inches in Hawaii in 1950. With Harvey, seven places beat out the 52-inch record and 18 places beat the 48-inch mark.  We learn about ongoing efforts to address human trafficking in Houston.

The program, which Congress failed to reauthorize last month, covers nearly 400,000 children from working-class families in the state. Just a few months ago, advocates said it was unclear when the state would run out of CHIP funds. Some advocates expected the state had until next September; others said funds would run out in February. Williams said the agency pushed up the timeline because of reduced income from co-pays. After Hurricane Harvey hit, the federal government waived co-pays and enrollment fees for CHIP recipients. That meant less money was coming into the program than expected. CHIP covers children in mostly working-class families. Koehler said CHIP pays for a wide range of services for children, including immunizations, eye exams and even cancer treatment, in some cases.

Between the federal government, the Red Cross and private charities, billions of dollars will be spent to help Hurricane Harvey victims in Texas. Almost a month and a half later, floodwaters have receded, leaving Texans in 39 counties to clean up rotting debris and destroyed homes. An estimated 1,100 people remained in eight different emergency shelters around the state earlier this week, and 62,304 Texas residents are still living in FEMA-paid hotel rooms. The Tribune will be updating these numbers regularly. That number will increase as the Red Cross continues accepting applications for the stipends via its website through Oct. 10. Sloan said the organization has deployed more than 7,300 workers to support efforts in Texas. Its emergency shelters, he said, have served more than 3.7 million meals and snacks and provided more than 421,000 overnight stays since Harvey hit. Sloan said that a cost breakdown for these services was not currently available. The foundation did not respond to a media inquiry asking how much of the money has been spent.

Then forecasters projected the weakened but still tropical storm would likely go back into the Gulf of Mexico, gain some strength and hit Houston next week. Harvey is projected to drop up to 3 feet (0.91 meter) of rain in some places over the next several days. But a second landfall near Houston means more storm surge coming from the Gulf. Storm surge is an abnormal rise of water above the normal tide, generated by a storm. Both the National Weather Service and the Harris County Flood Control District consider Harvey a life-threatening event. Even for those who have been through hurricanes. We are hurricane tested here in this state. Lindner said. The steering flow, the NWS said, will weaken considerably after landfall but a slow drift will result over the weekend and into early next week. That is not going to happen with this storm.

Because of its tremendous size, Sandy drove a catastrophic storm surge into the New Jersey and New York coastlines. Reporter Charles Lane is asking those exact questions. Lane joins us from New York to compare the response to Harvey with the response to Sandy. Highlights From Our Conversation: Charles Lane has reported on the government response to Hurricane Sandy for public radio stations WSHU and WNYC. What Happened After Sandy: Lane says there were accusations of fraud during the response to that storm, with forged engineer reports and general sloppiness in how claims were processed. That resulted in people who bought flood insurance policies getting shortchanged. While he sometimes saw adjusters who spent two or three hours assessing a damaged house, he also saw plenty of adjusters who spent only 30-35 minutes. He acknowledged adjusters are stretched very thin these days responding to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Nevertheless, Lane says the system favors speed over accuracy, to the detriment of both homeowners and taxpayers. Many adjusters were inexperienced and made errors.

So officials with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice developed a novel system: Inmates, they decided, could give away money saved in their commissary accounts; instead of spending their balances on snacks or sneakers, they would be allowed to give a few dollars to the American Red Cross. So when Hurricane Harvey spun into Texas in August, some longtime inmates who remembered the previous efforts insisted that officials restart the program. This time, the fund-raising was even more successful. Millions of dollars of relief have poured in from celebrities as well as average Americans, moved by the scope and extent of the destruction caused by Harvey. And every dollar counts.

Mexico City, Parched and Sinking, Faces a Water Crisis Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor. Water drains naturally in this stretch of Texas, or at least it used to. At more than 600 square miles, Houston has grown to be as big as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia combined, a giant spread of asphalt smothering many of the floodplains that once shuttled water from the prairies to the sea. When finished, the newest road to ring the city and propel its expansion, called the Grand Parkway, will encircle an area equivalent to all of Rhode Island. For years, the local authorities turned a blind eye to runaway development. Thousands of homes have been built next to, and even inside, the boundaries of the two big reservoirs devised by the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1940s after devastating floods. Back then, Houston was 20 miles downstream, its population 400,000. Today, these reservoirs are smack in the middle of an urban agglomeration of six million. We have bridged the continent with railways and roads, erected cities in the desert, and changed the course of rivers. Built on a mosquito-infested Texas swamp, Houston similarly willed itself into a great city. Its sprawl of highways and single-family homes is a postwar version of the American dream. Unfortunately, nature always gets the last word. The very forces that pushed the city forward are threatening its way of life. Sprawl is only part of the story. Houston is also built on an upbeat, pro-business strategy of low taxes and little government. Many Texans regard this as the key to prosperity, an antidote to Washington. It encapsulates a potent vision of an unfettered America. Harvey called that concept into question. It may have been an unusually bad hurricane, dumping trillions of gallons of water in a few days, even more to the east of the city than to the west, in the prairie, and setting all kinds of records. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Cypress Creek Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Buffalo Bayou Barker Reservoir Buildings Damaged by Hurricane Harvey Brays Bayou Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Buildings Damaged By Hurricane Harvey Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Barker Reservoir Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Cypress Creek Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Barker Reservoir Buffalo Bayou Brays Bayou Buildings Damaged By Hurricane Harvey Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. Global warming may not specifically have caused Harvey, any more than a single major league home run can be attributed to steroids. That said, scientists have little doubt that climate change is making storms worse and more frequent. Coming right after those events, Harvey has led even some pro-development enthusiasts to rethink the city and its surroundings.

Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor. A self-described traditional Republican and big backer of the Grand Parkway, Judge Emmett had planned on spending his twilight years in public service saving the Houston Astrodome from demolition. Harvey altered that. Now he thinks his mission is to protect the entire region. After every natural calamity, American politicians make big promises. They say: We will rebuild. We will not be defeated. Never again will we be caught unprepared. But they rarely tackle the toughest obstacles. Resettling neighborhoods, making certain places off-limits to development, creating dikes and reservoirs is difficult, both financially and politically. It takes longer than most election cycles. Memories fade. Inertia sets in. Residents just want to get their lives back to normal. Politicians want votes, not trouble. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans, for better and worse, used its cataclysm as an opportunity to reboot, not just fixing levees but overhauling public schools, hospitals and many neighborhoods. It was a wrenching process. The mere suggestion of moving people out of vulnerable neighborhoods set off bitter protests, causing the city to back down from some of its most sweeping proposals. Texas after Harvey is no different, and perhaps even less prepared to change. Like the rest of America, it is deeply divided between urban and rural, Democrat and Republican. Houston is a blue city with a black mayor in a bright red state. Ultimately, though, any resolution will require that everyone face the same threats together. The spread of asphalt and concrete has inhibited rainwater from draining naturally in Houston. When finished, the Grand Parkway, above, on the edge of Houston, will encircle an area equivalent to all of Rhode Island. He remembers escaping years ago to the prairie to bird watch. One recent morning he drove me out there along the Grand Parkway and pulled into an unfinished subdivision. The development, she said, adheres to county standards requiring that houses be raised above the 100-year floodplain. The woman handed Mr. Blackburn a glossy brochure and a disclaimer, which he scanned before climbing back into the car, shaking his head. The disclaimer explained that roads outside the development, linking it to the parkway, occupy the 10-year floodplain, meaning they would have about a 10 percent chance of flooding every year. But that requires politicians to agree. An upbeat narrative casts business-friendly Texas in the loner role of swashbuckling cowboy, disdainful of coastal elites. He believes cities are the culprit. For years, Texas Republicans promoted local controls to push against federal court orders on issues like desegregation and same-sex marriage. Now state leaders have made a U-turn. Little wonder, post-Harvey, that state and local officials have anointed different flood and recovery czars. Texas is sounding these days like Russia under the Romanovs. The system ensures nobody is clearly in charge. Least of all in Houston. Two other bills to study flooding in the Houston region, introduced in the last legislative session, died in committee. I met with the mayor in City Hall at the time. He noted that the Legislature had convened a special session to ban gender-neutral bathrooms. Another official, this one with the county, made the point that the area around Houston is a patchwork of counties and municipalities with different rules and no coordination because Texans believed the upside of what became, in essence, institutionalized entropy was that it allowed residents to avoid the encumbrances of city governments, regulations and taxes. The problem is that hurricanes and floods, worsened by climate change, do not recognize political borders or county lines. Their toll is shared by everyone. The hypocrisy of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, resisting federal aid to the New York region after Hurricane Sandy but then requesting it for Texas after Harvey, is in fact part of this same history. Bruce Hooper, outside his home in Kashmere Gardens in Houston, would like to move but has no place to go. Before it elected Mr. Turner, it elected a mayor who was a lesbian. The city is in thrall to cars and highways and has precious little mass transit, but the municipality of Houston relies more on renewable energy than any other big city in America. Houston has more green space, relative to paved, than New York. They insist that its business-friendly, light-on-regulations approach helps account for a big rise in employment since 2000. Decades later, Houston boasts of becoming the most diverse big city in the country, with comparatively low housing costs that translate to higher levels of minority homeownership. Harris County officials say they have received as many requests for buyouts since the hurricane (3,000) as there have been buyouts since the mid-1990s. Harvey turned out to be an equal opportunity disaster. They are among the homeowners hoping for a buyout. Buying out rich homes to repurpose vulnerable areas like Meyerland for flood detention, as Mr. Sacks notes, would require loads of money and remove valuable properties from tax rolls in a county that relies on property taxes. Bruce Hooper would move, too. During Harvey, he woke up to crackling sounds, when floodwaters started to seep into his appliances and electrical outlets. Mr. Hooper lives in a poor area called Kashmere Gardens. I found him sitting on a tattered lawn chair outside the shell of his tumbledown rental. An unemployed former parks employee, Mr. Hooper told me that he and his family of five had to be airlifted out by the Coast Guard after a detention pond overflowed and water inside the house rose from ankle to chest high in an hour. The Kahans own a single-story home in a middle-class neighborhood, Bear Creek Village. Christine Kahan and her husband had lived for 28 years in their house without a flood. Now Ms. Kahan said she would entertain a buyout. A part-time real-estate agent, she advises clients to think twice about buying any home that flooded. Hers is now one of them. But Mr. Kahan says they will stay, for the time being. I asked how that lined up with his desire not to leave Bear Creek. One afternoon I biked with Guy Hagstette around Buffalo Bayou Park. The Allen brothers were real estate swindlers from New York who founded Houston in 1836. After oil turned up beneath the muck and clay, they seemed like prophets. It collapsed riverbanks and left dunes of silt that buried pedestrian paths, playgrounds and fields. He meant not just repairing and fortifying the park, but also adapting Houston to the new normal. For starters, that will require fresh numbers. Harris County demands that new developments retain enough rainwater on site to neutralize the effects of a 100-year storm. But those 100-year numbers date back years. They are based on mitigating a storm that averages 13.2 inches of rain in 24 hours. Harvey brought 25.9 inches in 24 hours. The Memorial Day flood dropped 11 inches in three hours. The Tax Day flood dumped 17 inches in 12 hours in the Katy Prairie. As meteorologist for the Harris County Flood Control District, Mr. Lindner spent five sleepless days and nights during Harvey as an unshakable, tousled expert in a blue, button-down shirt, going on television and providing Houstonians with useful information. We met at the flood control district office one morning. Mr. Blackburn tells a story about a local hero, Jesse Jones, the former secretary of commerce, who helped secure federal funds for the ship channel. In 1929, Mr. Jones convinced fellow Houston bankers to put aside reserves of cash that prevented city banks from failing in the Depression. What may save Houston today, Mr. Blackburn said, is another common-sense strategy involving stricter controls and infrastructural investments that somehow lets state Republicans acquiesce behind closed doors but beat their chests in public. A hurricane that pushes a massive storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico into Galveston Bay, up the ship channel, could overwhelm refineries and unleash a toxic tsunami, killing many and rattling the national economy. The judge and mayor are among those talking about a so-called Ike Dike, named after Hurricane Ike in 2008, which killed dozens in Texas. It would be a massive sea-gate that could block a surge. The scale and engineering would be Texas-size. The cost would be, too. Judge Emmett asked, rhetorically, when we met in his office. Urban sprawl is only part of the story of Houston. The city was also built on an upbeat, pro-business strategy of low taxes and little government. Map by Ford Fessenden. Source: FEMA preliminary damage estimates. We would love to hear from you. Texas transportation officials are only beginning to assess how prolonged flooding has damaged roads and bridges. Alongside thousands of Texas homes and businesses impacted by Hurricane Harvey, floodwaters also damaged hundreds of roads and highways across the region. Prolonged flooding can wash out bridges, knock down traffic signals and signs and cause asphalt to buckle. As of Friday, more than 290 roads were closed in the areas affected by Harvey. TxDOT spokesman Bob Kaufman said the agency was making repairs where they could get in. But conditions needed to get better before they can fully begin the recovery process. More than 2,400 TxDOT employees are currently addressing the damage from Hurricane Harvey. Texans in Congress are already in the middle of talks to vote on a federal aid package for Harvey recovery efforts later this month. Preliminary flood data collected by the Dartmouth Flood Observatory using satellite imagery shows the extent of flood water across Southeast Texas. Because cloud cover can limit the availability of data, this represents the minimum likely extent of the flood water. Hurricane Ike was the last major hurricane to hit Texas in 2008. State crews managed to clear roads four days after Ike. Hurricane Harvey lingered in Texas for nearly a week, resulting in record-breaking rainfall and extensive flooding.

Dugay and her mother Angela, who is 53, each have a room in the trailer, and her 80-year-old grandfather, Herman, sleeps sitting up in the living room recliner, where he finds it easier to breathe. Mental health providers say the stress and instability is exacerbating existing anxieties and traumas. About 500 students had to leave the district to find shelter; they have slowly returned after the completion of apartment remodels or when their families find other homes. And when a student killed 10 classmates and teachers in a rural Houston-area school this spring, state lawmakers held a series of public hearings about how to screen students for mental health issues early and head off potential violent outbursts. But neither effort has resulted in consistent financial support that would allow schools to double the number of counselors to meet the ratio recommended by the American School Counselor Association. Texas school districts have historically leaned on community organizations to help boost their capacity to counsel students. In the Houston area, a coalition of almost 20 community organizations met regularly last school year to share the successes and challenges of their individual efforts, and brainstorm ways to coordinate services in schools across the region. Broussard recalled having to turn away a 10-year-old who had attempted suicide; the behavioral health hospital does not take kids under the age of 13, forcing parents to shuttle their young children miles away to Austin or Houston. The hospital recently received a state grant that will allow it to open a unit for children ages 6-12. The organization stationed more licensed mental health professionals in Port Arthur and Beaumont schools after Harvey, said executive director Reecie Goodman. In part, they worked to train educators to distinguish between a student acting out and a student dealing with anxiety. Washington said her 12-year-old daughter, who is terrified of drowning, became more clingy after the family was rescued from their flooded home during the hurricane. And her 8-year-old son gets anxious in the rain. Port Arthur ISD is hiring two additional social workers, one for the elementary school and one for the high school, said Superintendent Mark Porterie, who is still living in a two-bedroom trailer with his wife and daughter while his house is being repaired.

Instead, she finds solace in her packed extracurricular schedule, which kept her busy even in the summer as she rotated between basketball, softball and band practice. As she goes into her senior year, she plans to focus on her dream: majoring in music, maybe somewhere like Texas Christian University. At the party, the teenagers hefted bowling balls down the lanes, played arcade games, and just hung out and chatted.

Ellis, who was laid off from his job about two months earlier, was homeless and living under a bridge when Harvey hit coastal Texas and brought massive rains and flooding. Along with Ellis, about 3,000 others from across southeast Texas made their way to the shelter after floodwaters forced them from their homes. Many had nothing more than the clothes they were wearing and the possessions they could carry. Ellis, who has family in Shreveport, La., and elsewhere in the state, had only a few possessions. He carried them in a small trash bag. The line for clothing was long. Dry socks were in short supply at the shelter. Ellis' feet were in thin, wet, dirty socks and sandals.

Hurricane Harvey victims accused of stealing from church that took them in after storm By Dana Burke Two Montgomery suspects accused of stealing from the church that helped them after Hurricane Harvey have been arrested, the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office announced on Friday morning. Harvey intensified into a hurricane Thursday and steered for the Texas coast with the potential for up to 3 feet of rain, 125 mph winds and 12-foot storm surges in what could be the fiercest hurricane to hit the United States in almost a dozen years. The law allows police officers to ask people about their immigration status during routine stops. Harvey has been upgraded to a dangerous Category 3 hurricane. But Cal Soto, with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said there are options. Soto reminded that after Hurricane Katrina, in 2008, there was an announced suspension of immigration enforcement. Community organizers say Texas should prioritize helping low and moderate-income Hurricane Harvey victims as federal aid money is distributed. Chrishelle Palay, with coalition member Texas Housers, said the federal money should go to low and moderate-income Houstonians first, in part because those families typically live in historically black and brown neighborhoods that have already been under-invested in. Palay said the land office should meet directly with these communities to address their needs.

Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar said Hurricane Harvey was devastating for certain communities and individuals, but when you look at the overall impact on the state economy, it was minimal. He said certain types of businesses, like restaurants, are more affected as a result of reduced spending among hurricane victims. Others have even experienced a bump in business after Harvey. For example, auto sales went up significantly because people needed to replace vehicles lost in the flooding. But Hegar said this simply changes the timing of when people buy new cars. He said it will balance out over the long run. Some of them have earned him awards from Texas AP Broadcasters and the Houston Press Club. Florian is a native of Germany. His studies... Numerous Houston-area Democrats running for office this year are blaming incumbent Republicans for the slow pace of action on Harvey relief and flood mitigation.

There have been benefit concerts throughout Houston with performers ranging from Beyonce to the Houston Symphony. When she saw the news of Harvey, it immediately brought back memories of her Hurricane Katrina experiences. She decided she had to do something to help. So, while the rain was still falling in Houston, Trayanova took to the internet to orchestrate a benefit concert in New Orleans for Houstonians. There is a close network of New Orleans brass band players and musicians, many of them escaped to Houston during Katrina and where Houstonians and Houston musicians helped them to recover. In this piece, Matt Sakakeeny, Professor of Music from Tulane University and author of Roll With It, talks about the role these musicians play in the communities. Some musicians set up in Houston, like Kermit Ruffins, New Orleans trumpet player and co-owner of Axelrad Beer Garden, while others returned to New Orleans. But, they now all share a common bond. The musicians from these two cities are using the healing power of music to help those effected by Harvey to find comfort again, and through benefit concerts, some needed financial help as well.

It now has sustained winds of 45 mph (72 kph), up 5 mph (8 kph). Forecasters expect Harvey to stay over water and at 45 mph (72 kph) for 36 hours and then head back inland east of Houston sometime Wednesday. The forecast has the storm then zipping north and losing its tropical storm strength and then its tropical characteristics. Harvey made landfall in Texas late Friday as a Category 4 hurricane and has lingered just off the coast, dropping heavy rain as a tropical storm. Buffalo Bayou has swollen due to torrential rain from Harvey. Jeff Lindner is a meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District. He said Monday that levels on Buffalo Bayou have fallen from where they were Sunday. The Army Corps of Engineers says the controlled release into Buffalo Bayou is being done to relief pressure on the two aging reservoirs. Also, the senior citizens who appear in a now-viral photo showing them submerged in waist-deep water in a Texas assisted-living center flooded by Hurricane Harvey over the weekend have been relocated to a nearby facility and a hospital. The photo shows at least six senior citizens waist-deep in murky water, at least one sitting on a rolling walker, in a room with a popcorn machine, a cat and some bottles of water on a table. He said Lampson had made arrangements to evacuate the residents, but local authorities told her to stay put. Her husband has reported that she was napping when the tree fell. Harvey made landfall in Texas late Friday as a Category 4 hurricane and has lingered just off the coast, dropping heavy rain as a tropical storm. The storm has dumped historic amounts of rain on areas in and around Houston, which continues to flood. Turner toured the convention center Monday, hugging evacuees and asking how they were doing. The convention center was already more than halfway to its 5,000-person capacity. Turner said the city was considering its options for another major shelter, but did not say which buildings could be used. Harvey made landfall in Texas late Friday as a Category 4 hurricane and has lingered just off the coast, dropping heavy rain as a tropical storm. No bodies have been recovered. He told the children inside to try to escape through the back door, but they were unable to get out. Abbot expressed similar sentiments Sunday. Patients will be sent to other area hospitals until repairs are made. The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center also canceled outpatient services, appointments and surgeries at all Houston-area locations through Tuesday, and was asking patients not to attempt to travel because of high water in the Texas Medical Center area. Dickinson is a low-lying city about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Houston. Crews on Sunday rescued more than 20 residents and staffers from an assisted-living center in Dickinson that flooded. The police statement cited the fragile infrastructure in the city amid flooding, limited working utilities and concern for the forecast track of Harvey. Transportation was available for those needing help leaving Dickinson. Harvey made landfall in Texas late Friday as a Category 4 hurricane and has lingered just off the coast, dropping heavy rain as a tropical storm. An advisory Monday afternoon from the center says life-threatening flooding continues for Houston and the broader southeastern Texas region. Harvey has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 kph). The center says it may slowly intensify as it moves closer to the coast. Harvey is forecast to turn back toward the northeast at some point Tuesday. An additional 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rainfall is forecast through Friday and the center says other threats include tornadoes and a coastal storm surge of 1 to 3 feet (0.3 meter to 0.91 meter) moving inland from the coast. The Corps said Monday it was starting to release water from the two dams, called Addicks and Barker. The move would worsen flooding in some neighborhoods, but was necessary to prevent bigger, uncontrolled flows later, the Corps said in a statement. The Corps has acknowledged a long history of seepage through the dams. That includes nearly 20,000 calls just since 10 p.m. Sunday. Joe Laud is the administration manager for the Houston Emergency Center. He said Monday that 911 operators have been able to reduce the backlog of calls they have, going from 120 to 250 calls in their queue to 10 to 15 calls. He says that on average, the system usually get 8,000 or 9,000 calls per day. Laud says officials have also initiated a voice activated system that lets callers know that the 911 system has received their call and that they should stay on the phone until someone comes on the line. Harvey made landfall late Friday as a Category 4 hurricane and has lingered just off the coast, dropping heavy rain as a tropical storm. The Texas Republican on Monday toured the downtown convention center housing thousands of evacuees. But a multibillion dollar aid package is a sure bet to be added to an already packed agenda facing lawmakers when they return to Washington next week. An infusion of more FEMA money will be needed soon, however, given the magnitude of the storm. About 3,000 guard members had already been mobilized along the Texas coast. Abbott says Texas is now activating others who are physically able and not currently deployed elsewhere. Houston officials say they have rescued more than 2,000 people from flooding in the city. Harvey made landfall on Friday as a Category 4 hurricane. Those people then are struggling to find shelter, food and other resources. Emmett says the focus now is on getting those people to shelters. Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence is stressing that the federal government will support Harvey recovery efforts going forward. In an interview with Houston radio station KTRH Monday morning, Pence said the federal government will make the resources available to see Texas through rescue operations and recovery. The Army Corps of Engineers began controlled releases from the reservoirs shortly after midnight. But the levels in Addicks and Barker are still rising, at more than 1 foot per hour. The result is that water is backing up to the west of both reservoirs. Thousands of homes in the way are either already being flooded or at risk. They say the alternative would have been an uncontrolled release later. That would cause more damage, at the very least. But allowing the water to continue building could also threaten the structural integrity of the Addicks and Barker Dams. Those two dams are rated among the most unsafe in the country. He adds that while Houston is experiencing a break from the rain Monday morning, heavy rainfall is forecast to return later in the day into Tuesday. He also warned any criminals who might try to take advantage of the disaster that his force has already arrested half a dozen people for looting.

A National Weather Service official says the peak flooding from the Houston-area storm is expected to max out Wednesday and Thursday, but said the floods will be slow to recede and that catastrophic flooding will persist. The National Hurricane Center says in its 4 a.m. CDT update that the tropical storm that made landfall late Friday as a Category 4 hurricane, dropping heavy rain in the Houston area, still has sustained winds of up to 40 mph (65 kph) and is centered 20 miles (30 kilometers) east of Victoria, Texas, about 120 miles (193 kilometers) southwest of Houston. It continues to creep to the southeast at 3 mph (4.8 kph). That means it remains virtually stalled near the coast and continues to drop heavy rain on the Houston and Galveston areas. In the past 48 hours, numerous spots in the region have measured more than 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain. Harvey, which made landfall late Friday as a Category 4 hurricane and has lingered dropping heavy rain as a tropical storm, sent devastating floods pouring into Houston on Sunday. Rising water levels and continuing rain was putting pressure on the dams that could cause a failure without the release. Harris and Fort Bend county officials advised residents to pack their cars Sunday night and wait for daylight Monday to leave. The Army Corps of Engineers started the reservoir releases before 2 a.m. The timetable was moved up to prevent more homes from being flooded, Townsend said. County officials were preparing for the river to reach major flood stages late Sunday. Herbert said that amount of water would top the levees and carries a threat of levee failure. On Sunday, incessant rain covered much of Houston in turbid, gray-green water and turned streets into rivers navigable only by boat. In a rescue effort that recalled the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, helicopters landed near flooded freeways, airboats buzzed across submerged neighborhoods and high-water vehicles plowed through water-logged intersections. Some people managed with kayaks or canoes or swam. Volunteers joined emergency teams in pulling people from their homes or from the water. The flooding was so widespread that authorities had trouble pinpointing the worst areas. They urged people to get on top of their houses to avoid becoming trapped in attics and to wave sheets or towels to draw attention to their location. Judging from federal disaster declarations, the storm has so far affected about a quarter of the Texas population, or 6.8 million people in 18 counties. It was blamed in at least two deaths. As the water rose, the National Weather Service issued another ominous forecast: Before the storm that arrived Friday as a Category 4 hurricane is gone, some parts of Houston and its suburbs could get as much as 50 inches (1.3 meters) of rain. That would be the highest amount ever recorded in Texas. Some areas have already received about half that amount. Since Thursday, South Houston recorded nearly 25 inches (63 centimeters), and the suburbs of Santa Fe and Dayton got 27 inches (69 centimeters). Average rainfall totals will end up around 40 inches (1 meter) for Houston, weather service meteorologist Patrick Burke said. And several hospitals in the Houston area were evacuated due to the rising waters. It was not clear how many people were plucked from the floodwaters. It was also used as a shelter for Katrina refugees in 2005. Gillis Leho arrived there soaking wet. She said she awoke Sunday to find her downstairs flooded. She tried to move some belongings upstairs, then grabbed her grandchildren. Some people used inflatable beach toys, rubber rafts and even air mattresses to get through the water to safety. Others waded while carrying trash bags stuffed with their belongings and small animals in picnic coolers. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said authorities had received more than 2,000 calls for help, with more coming in. He urged drivers to stay off roads to avoid adding to the number of those stranded. The deteriorating situation was bound to provoke questions about the conflicting advice given by the governor and Houston leaders before the hurricane. The governor refused to point fingers on Sunday. The mayor, a Democrat, defended his decision, saying there was no way to know which parts of the city were most vulnerable. The Coast Guard deployed five helicopters and asked for additional aircraft from New Orleans. The White House announced that President Donald Trump would visit Texas on Tuesday. He met Sunday by teleconference with top administration officials to discuss federal support for response and recovery efforts. The rescues unfolded a day after Harvey settled over the Texas coastline. The system weakened Saturday to a tropical storm. By early Monday, Harvey had shifted a little closer to Texas, hovering about 20 miles (30 kilometers) east of Victoria, with sustained winds of about 40 mph (65 kph). The National Hurricane Center said it continued to edge in a southeasterly direction at 3 mph (4.8 kph). are using a browser that does not have Flash player enabled or installed.

Several months after Hurricane Harvey hit southern Texas, residents are still navigating the long recovery process. More than 100,000 homes were damaged in historic flooding, and thousands of residents are still living in hotels and rental housing while they wait for insurance checks. Roberts says they plan to rebuild and expected the estimated six- to nine-month rebuilding process to begin soon. Even though Roberts had flood insurance, she says her family will still have to borrow some money to cover the cost of rebuilding. Odum says federal money is needed to prepare the city for future disasters. While they could find a cheaper option than Airbnb, Roberts says her family of five needs the amenities offered because they lost everything. Copyright 2017 NPR. Nearly a year after Harvey, Houston Matters examines the progress that's been made in flood prevention since then. Plus, a local astronomer answers your questions about stargazing in Greater Houston. And writer W.F. Strong talks about his book Stories From Texas: Some of Them are True. The goal: to give beach managers a head start on removing seaweed quickly from the Texas coast. We learn more from Captain Robert Webster, a research assistant at Texas A&M-Galveston.  During and after the storm, Houstonians learn the value of a community and coming together in times of need. In fact by the time the storm cleared, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention was issuing warnings of health risks. But a local doctor said there may be some easy solution for some people. People dealing with sneezing, runny nose, irritated eyes. The biggest instigator is mold spores, which have increased following the storm. For those that only irritated by the pollen, mold, or dust, a simple, over-the-counter nasal irrigation is one solution. For those that are allergic to whatever Harvey has kicked up, Tran said doctors can prescribe shots or oral medications to treat your allergy. Joggers and cyclists zip along the trail that runs along the bayou. Visitors can also enjoy quiet patches of woodlands with benches and artwork.

We examine what those gaps are and how the region might bridge them to better serve the community going forward. The samples will be tested for contaminants including heavy metals. The floodwaters from Hurricane Harvey had to go somewhere. The storm dumped 50 inches of rain on parts of the Houston area in late August. Much of the water made its way through streets and bayous and eventually drained into the Houston Ship Channel, the busy commercial waterway that allows ships to travel between the Gulf of Mexico and industrial facilities around Houston. In the weeks since, the water has drained away, but scientists believe many of the contaminants it carried have not. Water rises in the Houston Ship Channel on Aug. 27. Some of the largest oil refineries in the world line the channel, which connects Houston to the Gulf of Mexico. Mercury is a heavy metal. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons are often released by petrochemical operations, like the ones that line the ship channel. Dioxins, in this case, could come from a Superfund toxic waste site nearby. The San Jacinto Waste Pits upstream flooded during the storm, and the Environmental Protection Agency said dioxins may have washed into the channel. Last week, the EPA announced a plan to remove nearly 212,000 cubic yards of contaminated material from the pits to prevent future contamination from floods. Other toxicology and environmental science teams from Texas A&M as well as Rice University and the University of Houston have also been testing sediment left by the storm, focusing on parts of the city such as Buffalo Bayou, which runs through downtown Houston, and residential areas that were flooded. In the Houston Ship Channel, the amount of sediment deposited can also reveal the scale of the storm. Harvey caused such severe flooding that the freshwater flowing into the ship channel pushed the leading edge of the salty water out toward the Gulf of Mexico. Usually, where the salty water begins, the sediment carried by freshwater ends, so looking at the sand left behind in the ship channel can help scientists understand how far out that so-called salt wedge was pushed. A core sample of mud from the bottom of the Houston Ship Channel. The lightest layer at the top of the tube is about 6 inches of sandy sediment left by the floods after Hurricane Harvey. Taking samples in the Houston Ship Channel can be challenging. The process requires anchoring the small research boat with vertical poles and then using a combination of winches, special coring equipment and muscle to sink hollow tubes into the mud below. Plus, the newly deposited sediment can be soupy, which makes it more likely to run out of the tubes before they can be pulled back onboard. But after a full day of work last week, the team succeeded in collecting a handful of samples. They showed about 6 inches of sandy mud left behind by Harvey in a part of the channel. Toxicologists at Texas A&M expect to have results from screening the sediment for contaminants by February. In addition to publishing their results in academic journals, they plan to share them with a range of health officials to help them plan for future disasters. Collections are taking places throughout the city, which is working to provide as much information as possible about scheduling for each area. Information about the schedule for each address or block is not available throughout the city at this point. The city recognizes the need to collect all debris as soon as possible following the record-high amount of rainfall produced by Hurricane Harvey. The mayor also announced that landfills will operate around 24 hours a day for debris collection. This will allow for trucks to deposit at any time during the day to collect and deposit debris, so that it is transferred to landfills by nighttime. Houston Matters learns what that means and gets your input. We take a closer look at the flood control projects voters will cast ballots on in August. And we get an update on Houston Sports. Read the report below. Houston Matters gets an update on how the process is going. School administrators have argued that all schools in the disaster area should automatically get waivers. That was Gov. Greg Abbott's message Wednesday after a briefing with President Donald Trump on hurricane preparedness. Delays in trials. Backlog of cases. A lack of jurors. Defense attorneys and prosecutors are worried what that could mean for victims and for jailed defendants waiting for their day in court. Until then, a soon-to-be-refurbished hardware store will have to do. The result so far: Criminal jury trials delayed by nearly two months, cramped working conditions for hundreds of employees, including judges sharing courtrooms, and courts relocated to buildings that are too small or not designed to hear criminal cases. Officials have tried to manage the influx of people at temporary courtroom locations by having fewer court dockets per week and scheduling these court hearings in the morning and afternoon. Normally, dockets are only held in the morning, she said. Jury trials in felony cases were to resume Monday, but there will only be two courtrooms available to try cases with defendants in custody instead of the nearly 40 that could be normally used, Brown said. After Harvey hit, the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals issued a joint order asking all courts in the state to temporarily suspend all deadlines and procedures in criminal and civil cases. The order is in place through Wednesday. Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said her office is aware of the concerns and has taken proactive measures, including dismissing several hundred low-level cases and, in certain types of cases where the threat to the public in minimal, agreeing to personal recognizance bonds that allow defendants to not pay bonds in exchange for a promise to appear in court. In Orange County, about 110 miles (177 kilometers) east of Houston near the Texas-Louisiana border, jury trials remain on hold after its courthouse was damaged, forcing courtrooms to be relocated to different buildings. If repairs take a long time, officials will look at finding a temporary building so jury trials can resume, according to Orange County Judge Stephen Carlton. Longtime local attorney Terry Collins said it could take years before the county and its legal system get back to normal. Collins is currently living in an RV with his wife in front of his law office after their home was destroyed by Harvey. Heard, the local court clerk, said judges are aware of these concerns and are hearing motions from defendants in custody about reducing bonds or granting personal recognizance bonds so they can be free while waiting for their cases to be resolved.

Houston set a new daily rainfall record Sunday, with 16.07 inches reported at the city's international airport, the National Weather Service says. Flooding unleashed by monster storm Harvey left Houston, the fourth-largest city in the United States, increasingly isolated as its airports and highways shut down and residents fled homes waist-deep in water. Around midday Monday, Gov. Greg Abbott activated the entire Texas National Guard to support communities coping with the flooding. He warned residents to stay vigilant as water levels rise. Several deaths have been reported in the floodwaters, but the exact number is unclear. A spokeswoman with the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences tells NPR at least six deaths are suspected of being related to the storm. Around midday Monday, Gov. Greg Abbott activated the entire Texas National Guard to support communities coping with the flooding. Thousands of Guard members were already deployed in the effort; the number now stands at roughly 12,000. Gates to Houston's reservoirs were opened as emergency crews and residents scrambled to deal with the intense rains brought by Harvey, which became a tropical storm after making landfall as a Category 4 hurricane late Friday. Catastrophic floods are expected to continue. So much rain has fallen, we've had to update the color charts on our graphics in order to effectively map it. On Saturday and Sunday, more than 2 feet of rain (24.44 inches) fell. That's the average annual rainfall in the area.

Flooded portions of Houston and other parts of Texas will see more heavy rainfall on Monday, as the National Weather Service issued new flash flood warnings for a wide area from Galveston inland to College Station. In a rescue effort that recalled the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, helicopters landed near flooded freeways, airboats buzzed across submerged neighborhoods and high-water vehicles plowed through water-logged intersections. Some people managed with kayaks or canoes or swam. The flooding was so widespread that authorities had trouble pinpointing the worst areas. With more rain to come, the ongoing storm has already capped off a three-month period in which Houston has received nearly a year's worth of rain, the National Weather Service says. The average yearly rainfall is just under 50 inches; Houston's airport has recorded more than 46 inches. Wow. Just wow. These are rainfall totals in Houston from the past 48-hours. And it's still raining as Harvey lingers. With both the Addicks and Barker reservoirs rising more than half a foot per hour, Zetterstrom said the goal is to give the water the most direct path to nearby Buffalo Bayou.

CreditEric Thayer for The New York Times By Christine Hauser Oct. 25, 2017 A 31-year-old man who helped repair houses in Galveston, Tex., after Hurricane Harvey has died of a rare infection caused by what is commonly known as flesh-eating bacteria, health officials said this week. The man went to the hospital on Oct. 10 with a seriously infected wound on his upper left arm, the Galveston County Health District said in a statement on Monday. He was told he had necrotizing fasciitis, a bacterial infection that kills soft tissue. He died on Oct. 16. Relatives who spoke to local news organizations identified the man as Josue Zurita. Everybody is very sad. It was the second reported death of a person from the infection since Hurricane Harvey swept through parts of Texas in August, inundating residential areas with filthy floodwaters that alarmed health officials. More than 75 people died in the hurricane, which made landfall in South Texas in late August and battered the region. The bacteria entered her body through cuts, the Harris County medical examiner said. It can be deadly in a very short time, unless it is promptly diagnosed and treated with antibiotics and surgery. The best way to prevent the infection is by cleaning and covering open wounds with dry bandages until they are healed. Various types of bacteria can cause the infection, but public health experts consider Group A streptococcus to be the most common, with about 700 to 1,100 such cases occurring each year in the United States since 2010, the C.D.C. said. Symptoms include warm skin with red or purplish areas of painful swelling after the injury, followed by fever, chills, fatigue and vomiting. Among other family members, he is survived by his wife and a daughter. Hauser is a senior staff editor on the news desk, where she covers national and foreign news.

Shefman said he was done waiting for his FEMA elevation grant application, and self-funded his own elevation. No humanity in the traumatic events that have already taken place. Drew Shefman, 43, said his heart aches for his neighbors, who flooded during Harvey. I mean, they elevated all of Galveston in the 1900s. Contreras said you can even find 18 foot elevations, over in Galveston. And he said the overall process generally takes about four to five months. To get them high and dry.

Mexico City, Parched and Sinking, Faces a Water Crisis Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor. Water drains naturally in this stretch of Texas, or at least it used to. At more than 600 square miles, Houston has grown to be as big as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia combined, a giant spread of asphalt smothering many of the floodplains that once shuttled water from the prairies to the sea. When finished, the newest road to ring the city and propel its expansion, called the Grand Parkway, will encircle an area equivalent to all of Rhode Island. For years, the local authorities turned a blind eye to runaway development. Thousands of homes have been built next to, and even inside, the boundaries of the two big reservoirs devised by the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1940s after devastating floods. Back then, Houston was 20 miles downstream, its population 400,000. Today, these reservoirs are smack in the middle of an urban agglomeration of six million. We have bridged the continent with railways and roads, erected cities in the desert, and changed the course of rivers. Built on a mosquito-infested Texas swamp, Houston similarly willed itself into a great city. Its sprawl of highways and single-family homes is a postwar version of the American dream. Unfortunately, nature always gets the last word. The very forces that pushed the city forward are threatening its way of life. Sprawl is only part of the story. Houston is also built on an upbeat, pro-business strategy of low taxes and little government. Many Texans regard this as the key to prosperity, an antidote to Washington. It encapsulates a potent vision of an unfettered America. Harvey called that concept into question. It may have been an unusually bad hurricane, dumping trillions of gallons of water in a few days, even more to the east of the city than to the west, in the prairie, and setting all kinds of records. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Cypress Creek Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Buffalo Bayou Barker Reservoir Buildings Damaged by Hurricane Harvey Brays Bayou Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Buildings Damaged By Hurricane Harvey Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Barker Reservoir Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Cypress Creek Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Barker Reservoir Buffalo Bayou Brays Bayou Buildings Damaged By Hurricane Harvey Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. Global warming may not specifically have caused Harvey, any more than a single major league home run can be attributed to steroids. That said, scientists have little doubt that climate change is making storms worse and more frequent. Coming right after those events, Harvey has led even some pro-development enthusiasts to rethink the city and its surroundings.

Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor. A self-described traditional Republican and big backer of the Grand Parkway, Judge Emmett had planned on spending his twilight years in public service saving the Houston Astrodome from demolition. Harvey altered that. Now he thinks his mission is to protect the entire region. After every natural calamity, American politicians make big promises. They say: We will rebuild. We will not be defeated. Never again will we be caught unprepared. But they rarely tackle the toughest obstacles. Resettling neighborhoods, making certain places off-limits to development, creating dikes and reservoirs is difficult, both financially and politically. It takes longer than most election cycles. Memories fade. Inertia sets in. Residents just want to get their lives back to normal. Politicians want votes, not trouble. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans, for better and worse, used its cataclysm as an opportunity to reboot, not just fixing levees but overhauling public schools, hospitals and many neighborhoods. It was a wrenching process. The mere suggestion of moving people out of vulnerable neighborhoods set off bitter protests, causing the city to back down from some of its most sweeping proposals. Texas after Harvey is no different, and perhaps even less prepared to change. Like the rest of America, it is deeply divided between urban and rural, Democrat and Republican. Houston is a blue city with a black mayor in a bright red state. Ultimately, though, any resolution will require that everyone face the same threats together. The spread of asphalt and concrete has inhibited rainwater from draining naturally in Houston. When finished, the Grand Parkway, above, on the edge of Houston, will encircle an area equivalent to all of Rhode Island. He remembers escaping years ago to the prairie to bird watch. One recent morning he drove me out there along the Grand Parkway and pulled into an unfinished subdivision. The development, she said, adheres to county standards requiring that houses be raised above the 100-year floodplain. The woman handed Mr. Blackburn a glossy brochure and a disclaimer, which he scanned before climbing back into the car, shaking his head. The disclaimer explained that roads outside the development, linking it to the parkway, occupy the 10-year floodplain, meaning they would have about a 10 percent chance of flooding every year. But that requires politicians to agree. An upbeat narrative casts business-friendly Texas in the loner role of swashbuckling cowboy, disdainful of coastal elites. He believes cities are the culprit. For years, Texas Republicans promoted local controls to push against federal court orders on issues like desegregation and same-sex marriage. Now state leaders have made a U-turn. Little wonder, post-Harvey, that state and local officials have anointed different flood and recovery czars. Texas is sounding these days like Russia under the Romanovs. The system ensures nobody is clearly in charge. Least of all in Houston. Two other bills to study flooding in the Houston region, introduced in the last legislative session, died in committee. I met with the mayor in City Hall at the time. He noted that the Legislature had convened a special session to ban gender-neutral bathrooms. Another official, this one with the county, made the point that the area around Houston is a patchwork of counties and municipalities with different rules and no coordination because Texans believed the upside of what became, in essence, institutionalized entropy was that it allowed residents to avoid the encumbrances of city governments, regulations and taxes. The problem is that hurricanes and floods, worsened by climate change, do not recognize political borders or county lines. Their toll is shared by everyone. The hypocrisy of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, resisting federal aid to the New York region after Hurricane Sandy but then requesting it for Texas after Harvey, is in fact part of this same history. Bruce Hooper, outside his home in Kashmere Gardens in Houston, would like to move but has no place to go. Before it elected Mr. Turner, it elected a mayor who was a lesbian. The city is in thrall to cars and highways and has precious little mass transit, but the municipality of Houston relies more on renewable energy than any other big city in America. Houston has more green space, relative to paved, than New York. They insist that its business-friendly, light-on-regulations approach helps account for a big rise in employment since 2000. Decades later, Houston boasts of becoming the most diverse big city in the country, with comparatively low housing costs that translate to higher levels of minority homeownership. Harris County officials say they have received as many requests for buyouts since the hurricane (3,000) as there have been buyouts since the mid-1990s. Harvey turned out to be an equal opportunity disaster. They are among the homeowners hoping for a buyout. Buying out rich homes to repurpose vulnerable areas like Meyerland for flood detention, as Mr. Sacks notes, would require loads of money and remove valuable properties from tax rolls in a county that relies on property taxes. Bruce Hooper would move, too. During Harvey, he woke up to crackling sounds, when floodwaters started to seep into his appliances and electrical outlets. Mr. Hooper lives in a poor area called Kashmere Gardens. I found him sitting on a tattered lawn chair outside the shell of his tumbledown rental. An unemployed former parks employee, Mr. Hooper told me that he and his family of five had to be airlifted out by the Coast Guard after a detention pond overflowed and water inside the house rose from ankle to chest high in an hour. The Kahans own a single-story home in a middle-class neighborhood, Bear Creek Village. Christine Kahan and her husband had lived for 28 years in their house without a flood. Now Ms. Kahan said she would entertain a buyout. A part-time real-estate agent, she advises clients to think twice about buying any home that flooded. Hers is now one of them. But Mr. Kahan says they will stay, for the time being. I asked how that lined up with his desire not to leave Bear Creek. One afternoon I biked with Guy Hagstette around Buffalo Bayou Park. The Allen brothers were real estate swindlers from New York who founded Houston in 1836. After oil turned up beneath the muck and clay, they seemed like prophets. It collapsed riverbanks and left dunes of silt that buried pedestrian paths, playgrounds and fields. He meant not just repairing and fortifying the park, but also adapting Houston to the new normal. For starters, that will require fresh numbers. Harris County demands that new developments retain enough rainwater on site to neutralize the effects of a 100-year storm. But those 100-year numbers date back years. They are based on mitigating a storm that averages 13.2 inches of rain in 24 hours. Harvey brought 25.9 inches in 24 hours. The Memorial Day flood dropped 11 inches in three hours. The Tax Day flood dumped 17 inches in 12 hours in the Katy Prairie. As meteorologist for the Harris County Flood Control District, Mr. Lindner spent five sleepless days and nights during Harvey as an unshakable, tousled expert in a blue, button-down shirt, going on television and providing Houstonians with useful information. We met at the flood control district office one morning. Mr. Blackburn tells a story about a local hero, Jesse Jones, the former secretary of commerce, who helped secure federal funds for the ship channel. In 1929, Mr. Jones convinced fellow Houston bankers to put aside reserves of cash that prevented city banks from failing in the Depression. What may save Houston today, Mr. Blackburn said, is another common-sense strategy involving stricter controls and infrastructural investments that somehow lets state Republicans acquiesce behind closed doors but beat their chests in public. A hurricane that pushes a massive storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico into Galveston Bay, up the ship channel, could overwhelm refineries and unleash a toxic tsunami, killing many and rattling the national economy. The judge and mayor are among those talking about a so-called Ike Dike, named after Hurricane Ike in 2008, which killed dozens in Texas. It would be a massive sea-gate that could block a surge. The scale and engineering would be Texas-size. The cost would be, too. Judge Emmett asked, rhetorically, when we met in his office. Urban sprawl is only part of the story of Houston. The city was also built on an upbeat, pro-business strategy of low taxes and little government. Map by Ford Fessenden. Source: FEMA preliminary damage estimates. We would love to hear from you.

Mayor Sylvester Turner has ordered police and other city departments to get more information on why. The city saw 269 murders over the whole of 2017. That is down about 11 percent compared to the last two years. Turner credited the Houston Police Department for the decline, saying officers had improved their responsiveness despite a lack of resources. The mayor said that some of the increase may stem from post-traumatic stress disorders tied to Harvey. Turner said that, based on the data, the City will request additional state and federal funding to deal with post-traumatic stress from Harvey and from future storms like it.

A region eyes recovery With rainfall topping 50 inches in some areas, Harvey devastated a swath of Texas stretching from the Houston area into Louisiana. Even as the rain and wind moved on, the region continued to suffer consequences of the storm. Explosions rocked a chemical plant early Thursday, and many hazards lurk beneath the floodwaters that soaked the region. The storm has also forced Houston to grapple with the limits of its growth. Video Some families hit hard by Tropical Storm Harvey are choosing to stay in their flooded homes.

The human toll At least 39 people have died, including a Houston police officer, a family trapped in a van beneath surging floodwater, and a mother whose shivering 3-year-old was found clinging to her unresponsive body. Survivors face hurdles of their own, with help likely to be slow in coming. Rich and poor alike have had their homes and lives upended. There were many positive stories, too. A huge volunteer effort operated with little official guidance. A businessman turned his mattress store into a safe haven. And the women and cat in a viral photo of a flooded nursing home are safe. The Houston Independent School District also said that all students will receive three free meals a day for the school year. What set Harvey apart was its rain. Once it made landfall, the storm essentially stalled, turning roads into rivers. Scientists say it was fueled by a deadly combination of environmental factors. Video Homes and shelters were flooded and the largest oil refinery in the U.S. was shut down after heavy rains flooded Port Arthur, east of Houston, overnight Tuesday.

Mexico City, Parched and Sinking, Faces a Water Crisis Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor. Water drains naturally in this stretch of Texas, or at least it used to. At more than 600 square miles, Houston has grown to be as big as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia combined, a giant spread of asphalt smothering many of the floodplains that once shuttled water from the prairies to the sea. When finished, the newest road to ring the city and propel its expansion, called the Grand Parkway, will encircle an area equivalent to all of Rhode Island. For years, the local authorities turned a blind eye to runaway development. Thousands of homes have been built next to, and even inside, the boundaries of the two big reservoirs devised by the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1940s after devastating floods. Back then, Houston was 20 miles downstream, its population 400,000. Today, these reservoirs are smack in the middle of an urban agglomeration of six million. We have bridged the continent with railways and roads, erected cities in the desert, and changed the course of rivers. Built on a mosquito-infested Texas swamp, Houston similarly willed itself into a great city. Its sprawl of highways and single-family homes is a postwar version of the American dream. Unfortunately, nature always gets the last word. The very forces that pushed the city forward are threatening its way of life. Sprawl is only part of the story. Houston is also built on an upbeat, pro-business strategy of low taxes and little government. Many Texans regard this as the key to prosperity, an antidote to Washington. It encapsulates a potent vision of an unfettered America. Harvey called that concept into question. It may have been an unusually bad hurricane, dumping trillions of gallons of water in a few days, even more to the east of the city than to the west, in the prairie, and setting all kinds of records. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Cypress Creek Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Buffalo Bayou Barker Reservoir Buildings Damaged by Hurricane Harvey Brays Bayou Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Buildings Damaged By Hurricane Harvey Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Barker Reservoir Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Cypress Creek Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Barker Reservoir Buffalo Bayou Brays Bayou Buildings Damaged By Hurricane Harvey Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. Global warming may not specifically have caused Harvey, any more than a single major league home run can be attributed to steroids. That said, scientists have little doubt that climate change is making storms worse and more frequent. Coming right after those events, Harvey has led even some pro-development enthusiasts to rethink the city and its surroundings.

Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor. A self-described traditional Republican and big backer of the Grand Parkway, Judge Emmett had planned on spending his twilight years in public service saving the Houston Astrodome from demolition. Harvey altered that. Now he thinks his mission is to protect the entire region. After every natural calamity, American politicians make big promises. They say: We will rebuild. We will not be defeated. Never again will we be caught unprepared. But they rarely tackle the toughest obstacles. Resettling neighborhoods, making certain places off-limits to development, creating dikes and reservoirs is difficult, both financially and politically. It takes longer than most election cycles. Memories fade. Inertia sets in. Residents just want to get their lives back to normal. Politicians want votes, not trouble. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans, for better and worse, used its cataclysm as an opportunity to reboot, not just fixing levees but overhauling public schools, hospitals and many neighborhoods. It was a wrenching process. The mere suggestion of moving people out of vulnerable neighborhoods set off bitter protests, causing the city to back down from some of its most sweeping proposals. Texas after Harvey is no different, and perhaps even less prepared to change. Like the rest of America, it is deeply divided between urban and rural, Democrat and Republican. Houston is a blue city with a black mayor in a bright red state. Ultimately, though, any resolution will require that everyone face the same threats together. The spread of asphalt and concrete has inhibited rainwater from draining naturally in Houston. When finished, the Grand Parkway, above, on the edge of Houston, will encircle an area equivalent to all of Rhode Island. He remembers escaping years ago to the prairie to bird watch. One recent morning he drove me out there along the Grand Parkway and pulled into an unfinished subdivision. The development, she said, adheres to county standards requiring that houses be raised above the 100-year floodplain. The woman handed Mr. Blackburn a glossy brochure and a disclaimer, which he scanned before climbing back into the car, shaking his head. The disclaimer explained that roads outside the development, linking it to the parkway, occupy the 10-year floodplain, meaning they would have about a 10 percent chance of flooding every year. But that requires politicians to agree. An upbeat narrative casts business-friendly Texas in the loner role of swashbuckling cowboy, disdainful of coastal elites. He believes cities are the culprit. For years, Texas Republicans promoted local controls to push against federal court orders on issues like desegregation and same-sex marriage. Now state leaders have made a U-turn. Little wonder, post-Harvey, that state and local officials have anointed different flood and recovery czars. Texas is sounding these days like Russia under the Romanovs. The system ensures nobody is clearly in charge. Least of all in Houston. Two other bills to study flooding in the Houston region, introduced in the last legislative session, died in committee. I met with the mayor in City Hall at the time. He noted that the Legislature had convened a special session to ban gender-neutral bathrooms. Another official, this one with the county, made the point that the area around Houston is a patchwork of counties and municipalities with different rules and no coordination because Texans believed the upside of what became, in essence, institutionalized entropy was that it allowed residents to avoid the encumbrances of city governments, regulations and taxes. The problem is that hurricanes and floods, worsened by climate change, do not recognize political borders or county lines. Their toll is shared by everyone. The hypocrisy of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, resisting federal aid to the New York region after Hurricane Sandy but then requesting it for Texas after Harvey, is in fact part of this same history. Bruce Hooper, outside his home in Kashmere Gardens in Houston, would like to move but has no place to go. Before it elected Mr. Turner, it elected a mayor who was a lesbian. The city is in thrall to cars and highways and has precious little mass transit, but the municipality of Houston relies more on renewable energy than any other big city in America. Houston has more green space, relative to paved, than New York. They insist that its business-friendly, light-on-regulations approach helps account for a big rise in employment since 2000. Decades later, Houston boasts of becoming the most diverse big city in the country, with comparatively low housing costs that translate to higher levels of minority homeownership. Harris County officials say they have received as many requests for buyouts since the hurricane (3,000) as there have been buyouts since the mid-1990s. Harvey turned out to be an equal opportunity disaster. They are among the homeowners hoping for a buyout. Buying out rich homes to repurpose vulnerable areas like Meyerland for flood detention, as Mr. Sacks notes, would require loads of money and remove valuable properties from tax rolls in a county that relies on property taxes. Bruce Hooper would move, too. During Harvey, he woke up to crackling sounds, when floodwaters started to seep into his appliances and electrical outlets. Mr. Hooper lives in a poor area called Kashmere Gardens. I found him sitting on a tattered lawn chair outside the shell of his tumbledown rental. An unemployed former parks employee, Mr. Hooper told me that he and his family of five had to be airlifted out by the Coast Guard after a detention pond overflowed and water inside the house rose from ankle to chest high in an hour. The Kahans own a single-story home in a middle-class neighborhood, Bear Creek Village. Christine Kahan and her husband had lived for 28 years in their house without a flood. Now Ms. Kahan said she would entertain a buyout. A part-time real-estate agent, she advises clients to think twice about buying any home that flooded. Hers is now one of them. But Mr. Kahan says they will stay, for the time being. I asked how that lined up with his desire not to leave Bear Creek. One afternoon I biked with Guy Hagstette around Buffalo Bayou Park. The Allen brothers were real estate swindlers from New York who founded Houston in 1836. After oil turned up beneath the muck and clay, they seemed like prophets. It collapsed riverbanks and left dunes of silt that buried pedestrian paths, playgrounds and fields. He meant not just repairing and fortifying the park, but also adapting Houston to the new normal. For starters, that will require fresh numbers. Harris County demands that new developments retain enough rainwater on site to neutralize the effects of a 100-year storm. But those 100-year numbers date back years. They are based on mitigating a storm that averages 13.2 inches of rain in 24 hours. Harvey brought 25.9 inches in 24 hours. The Memorial Day flood dropped 11 inches in three hours. The Tax Day flood dumped 17 inches in 12 hours in the Katy Prairie. As meteorologist for the Harris County Flood Control District, Mr. Lindner spent five sleepless days and nights during Harvey as an unshakable, tousled expert in a blue, button-down shirt, going on television and providing Houstonians with useful information. We met at the flood control district office one morning. Mr. Blackburn tells a story about a local hero, Jesse Jones, the former secretary of commerce, who helped secure federal funds for the ship channel. In 1929, Mr. Jones convinced fellow Houston bankers to put aside reserves of cash that prevented city banks from failing in the Depression. What may save Houston today, Mr. Blackburn said, is another common-sense strategy involving stricter controls and infrastructural investments that somehow lets state Republicans acquiesce behind closed doors but beat their chests in public. A hurricane that pushes a massive storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico into Galveston Bay, up the ship channel, could overwhelm refineries and unleash a toxic tsunami, killing many and rattling the national economy. The judge and mayor are among those talking about a so-called Ike Dike, named after Hurricane Ike in 2008, which killed dozens in Texas. It would be a massive sea-gate that could block a surge. The scale and engineering would be Texas-size. The cost would be, too. Judge Emmett asked, rhetorically, when we met in his office. Urban sprawl is only part of the story of Houston. The city was also built on an upbeat, pro-business strategy of low taxes and little government. Map by Ford Fessenden. Source: FEMA preliminary damage estimates. We would love to hear from you. Houston took a big blow in home sales in the month of August, primarily because Harvey hit late in the month when closings are typically scheduled.

Schools across Houston and parts of Texas' Gulf Coast will remain shuttered through Labor Day - and possibly much longer - because many buildings and roadways may need repairs even after Harvey's unprecedented floodwaters subside. To that end, KIPP this week established a Family Emergency Fund to underwrite donations for food, gas, clothing and other essentials.  A new study suggests that massive hurricanes like Harvey are expected to strike Houston and Texas with much greater frequency in the future than they do now. According to a study published Monday in PNAS, the odds of Harvey-like rains drenching the city of Houston will grow from 1 in 2,000 at the beginning of the 21st century to 1 in 100 at the end of the century. For Texas as a whole, the outlook is even worse. The frequency of hurricanes with rains in excess of 20 inches occurring anywhere in the state will jump from a once in a 100-year event at the end of the 20th century to a once in 5.5 year occurrence at the end of the 21st century. The new work was led by MIT atmospheric scientist Kerry Emanuel, who specializes in hurricanes. To come to these conclusions, Emanuel relied on hurricane models that are used by the National Hurricane Center to forecast hurricanes in real time. He also used an array of six global climate models that take into account a standard, business-as-usual greenhouse gas emission scenario. Currently about 90 hurricanes a year occur somewhere on the globe, Emanuel said. That overall number is not expected to change as the planet heats up, and in fact it might even go down. He added that there are three primary reasons why a warming climate would produce more severe hurricanes in Texas in particular. For one, the data show a slight uptick in the number of strong hurricanes that will move into that region. More importantly, however, is that each given hurricane will produce more rain because warmer air can hold more water. The techniques used in the paper are not new, but Emanuel said the significance of the paper is to alert city planners to the changing probabilities of large-scale hurricanes in Texas as soon as possible.

Clark said no decision has been made on when convicts will return to the three remaining prisons that were evacuated -- Stringfellow, Ramsey and Terrell. 9:55 a.m. Brazos River still high, but retreating Days after cresting at a record-high water level, the Brazos River has retreated to the moderate flood stage level. Monday measurements from the National Weather Service show the river at a height of 49.6 feet, a read that puts it just below the major flood stage. The river topped 55 feet for the first time ever last week, devastating towns and neighborhoods throughout Fort Bend and Brazoria counties. The NWS expects the river's water level will fall into the minor flooding stage by Tuesday, and then rapidly decrease throughout the week. 9:34 a.m. Man with Alzheimer's reported missing since Friday A 63-year-old man with early onset Alzheimer's disease has been missing since last week.

At that moment, in a dry neighborhood across town, a few dozen residents were enjoying brunch at Pax Americana: Brisket hash, honey-butter chicken, cold mimosas. More than a week after the worst disaster in state history, Houston officials and residents began confronting a city of contrasts: Between those spared by Harvey, and those still in crisis. Between aiding people in need, and returning to business as usual. Between starting the rebuilding process, and pausing to reconsider the cost of unmitigated development.

A combined 13,300 cubic feet of water is flowing from the two reservoirs each second, according to the Harris County Flood Control District. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is managing the reservoirs. As a result of the flows, flood control officials said the pools behind Addicks and Barker are shrinking, though it will be up to two weeks before homes impacted are out of the water. In the meantime, officials do not expect more homes to flood downstream along Buffalo Bayou. City officials called for mandatory evacuations on Saturday, which led some to worry more flooding was imminent. Houston District G Councilman Greg Travis sent notes Sunday trying to tamp down the concerns. Mayor Sylvester Turner said the evacuations were necessary to ensure safety of residents and first responders. Electricity to the area was being shut off to protect everyone from downed lines. 10:35 a.m.: First-responders going door-to-door in West Houston mandatory evacuation area CenterPoint and first responders are walking the flooded areas marked for mandatory evacuation in west Houston to determine where power needs to be shut off. The area in question is from State Highway 6 to South Gessner and From Highway 10 south to Briar Forest. Residents in that area who have water in their homes are being asked to evacuate as soon as possible. All CenterPoint employees will be accompanied by a law enforcement officer of someone from the fire department. Municipal workers report back on Tuesday, after the Memorial Day holiday, and Turner said the long rebuilding process will continue as Houston roars back to life. Turner, however, did not diminish the gravity of what lies ahead. Debris piles the size of railcars must be hauled away from some inundated communities. He told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd that simply cleaning up could take 10 days, while rebuilding is poised to last much longer. The rebuild, however, might not be a return to Houston exactly as it has been, according to Gov. Greg Abbott. Meanwhile, Abbott, Turner and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz both applauded the way the community pulled together in crisis as they made the television rounds. 7:56 a.m.: Four rescued from fierce Neches River waters Four boaters stranded without fuel upstream from Beaumont on the Neches River were plucked from the waters by a U.S. Coast Guard recovery team on Saturday night, Jefferson County officials said.

Our staff has the full story here. 7:30 p.m. Harris County flood control officials: no more uncontrolled releases from Addicks, Barker Water is no longer spilling out of the north side of Addicks reservoir, Harris County Flood Control District Officials said Saturday. That means flooding near Eldridge Parkway and Tanner Road from the uncontrolled releases is decreasing. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is still releasing about 13,300 cubic feet per second of water from Addicks and Barker reservoirs. This has been largely the same for days. Water from Tropical Storm Harvey pooling in the reservoirs has caused widespread flooding upstream, while releases contributed to flooding of thousands of homes along Buffalo Bayou. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner called for a mandatory evacuation of west Houston homes that are inundated. 7:15 p.m. Harris County ramps up debris collection People who live in unincorporated Harris County and need help with debris removal or repairs to their homes can call a hotline with questions: (713) 274-3880. The hotline can help people answer questions about debris removal, permits needed to repair or rebuild homes or other buildings, and other general questions about basic needs. 6:15 p.m. FEMA registration applications top half a million The Federal Emergency Management Agency has received more than 507,000 applications for aid in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. 5:40 p.m. Mayor Sylvester Turner orders mandatory evacuation of West Houston homes flooded by Buffalo Bayou and dam releases Mayor Sylvester Turner ordered a mandatory evacuation of an area of West Houston which has been inundated by high waters on Buffalo Bayou. The order affects areas of Houston south of I-10, north of Briarforest, east of Addicks and Barker reservoirs and west of Gessner. About 300 people are believed to be in the area, which includes approximately 4,000 homes. That part of Houston will likely be underwater for weeks as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers releases water from the Addicks and Barker reservoirs to empty them out in case they need to hold back water from future rains.

HCAD asks residents to provide name, address, phone number, account number and inches or feet of water that flooded victims' homes. City officials say this is a scam, and that real warnings come between 30 and 90 days before an insurance company rescinds coverage. The officials said victims receiving these robo-calls should call their insurance companies or the National Flood Insurance Program at 1-800-638-6620. 3:50 p.m. PetWell Partners to offer free vet services after Harvey When PetWell Partners reopened its Bellaire clinic just a few days after Tropical Storm Harvey swept the region, David Strauss realized the toll the storm had taken on hundreds of desperate pet owners. The co-founder of the company met a couple whose dog had been having seizures for three days. At one point, they brought it to a fire station to get oxygen, Strauss said. PetWell Partners, which reopened eight of its animal clinics throughout the Houston area, will offer free services and supplies for pets sickened or injured during the storm. Starting Monday, vets will provide basic screening and treatments at certain locations. Our Katherine Blunt has the full story here.

Ramirez was the first mother at Carrillo Elementary School Saturday morning receiving a free hot lunch for herself and her three daughters as part of a new HISD effort that launched Saturday to aid Harvey victims. The brisket sandwiches, mashed potatoes and diced pears were a welcomed reprieve from the few beans and rice the Ramirez family subsisted on for days. The remaining food stamps in her possession were barely enough for Ramirez to shop at the nearby Fiesta Mart, which itself had been running low on supplies for the storm's duration. Water seeped into their one bedroom apartment a few blocks away from the school, but the only damage sustained was a soaked living room carpet that has already been torn out. Structural damage to their house during Hurricane Ike forced the family to move into an apartment with a more manageable rent. Last year they moved again, this time into the apartments surrounding Fiesta and the school. School officials put out calls to neighboring families in both English and Spanish announcing the free breakfast, lunch, and dinner available this weekend. Concerned some may have lost power and therefore missed the phone call, staff members printed out flyers on Saturday to deliver door-to-door.

The Legislature may be out of session, but state lawmakers are looking at how to help public and charter schools battered by Harvey. Both Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick and House Speaker Joe Straus have told their committees to start working on solutions to problems Harvey created or worsened. The most basic issue is simply fixing damaged buildings. Harvey could also force lawmakers to deal with the problem of school finance, which the House and Senate deadlocked over during the last session. Property taxes are the main source of funding for Texas school districts. Those tax receipts are likely to fall along with the value of homes damaged by Harvey. State funding for schools depends on student attendance. The House Public Education Committee is set to hold a hearing on Thursday, October 12, at the State Capitol in Austin. He also reports on major policy issues before the Texas delegations in the U.S. House and Senate, as well as the Texas governorship, the state legislature, and county and city governments. Before taking up his current post, Andrew... Turnout typically drops during off-year elections. Nearly two months after Harvey, more than 100,000 people are still displaced from their homes in Houston and Harris County alone. The storm totaled thousands of cars in a city dependent on private transportation. All that makes it a lot harder for would-be voters to get to the polls. Harris is far from the only county likely to face lower voter turnout due to Harvey. Last Friday, Governor Abbott extended disaster declarations for 60 counties. He also reports on major policy issues before the Texas delegations in the U.S. House and Senate, as well as the Texas governorship, the state legislature, and county and city governments.

The house they renovated and expanded over three decades has been gutted down to its wooden beams. Almost three months after Hurricane Harvey slammed into the Texas Gulf Coast, killing more than 80 people and damaging at least 200,000 homes, the Dorseys and other families are celebrating Thanksgiving however they can. Or they might go to a local buffet-style restaurant for turkey and trimmings. Some people are gathering at churches that have held large meals for people displaced by the storm and volunteers spending the holiday away from their families to help rebuild. Thursday. Blocks that had piles of debris on every front lawn are being cleared. Work crews are in neighborhoods all over the city, and nonprofit groups have distributed hundreds of millions in aid. But more than 47,000 people across Texas, including the Dorseys, are still staying in hotels with vouchers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Others are staying with family members or have left Southeast Texas altogether, abandoning mortgages on homes that were wrecked by floodwaters. Some people are still living in apartments infested with mold. The Dorseys were rescued from their home the second night of the storm by a National Guard truck, with Guardsmen pulling them out of floodwaters that had reached several feet and still rising. The Guard took them to a nearby Baptist church, where they slept for two nights on the floor until cots arrived. They spent a week at the church, where they celebrated their 35th anniversary with a dance as other evacuees toasted them holding paper cups filled with punch. Dozens of volunteers from churches all over the world have since arrived in their neighborhood, many of them unprompted, to help rebuild. The staccato sound of nail guns rang out as he talked. The air inside was dry, but dusty. Dorsey retired after 25 years working at an ExxonMobil plastics plant and now serves at a deacon at his church. With the booming voice of a preacher, Dorsey told long stories about the history of each room and his four sons, ranging in age from 31 to 16. Arva Dorsey, 58, sat outside with a few of her neighbors, smiling and joking wryly about how much her husband could talk. She had a walker in front of her. The first time she came back to the house, she slipped on a step where water had seeped in from the drywall. She tore the cartilage in her left knee and had surgery earlier this month. But even if the kitchen had survived the storm, Arva Dorsey says it would have been too physically painful to spend three days preparing dinner as she normally does. George acknowledged that part of him wished they were back in their house already. But he knew that he needed to let the foundation of the home dry out and take his time replacing what he had lost. Meanwhile, many Houstonians are having to decide what stays and what goes. A recent visit to one southeast Houston neighborhood found crews picking up debris and residents going through the process of deciding what stays and what goes. Officials estimate Harvey left behind some 8 million cubic yards of debris. That includes walking, driving, cycling, taking the bus, and occasionally flying.

Houston bore the brunt of it and has received the most attention. Lumber, tools and other equipment are scattered around the yard. Kendrick said Hurricane Harvey gave his home a wallop and not many in Fulton were spared. But a structure will be coming soon, Kendrick said. He said his roof leaks and only the front of the house has electricity. Recently, Kendrick and other coastal bend officials testified at a hearing before state lawmakers. Our public works building was completely destroyed with most of the vehicles. Our library is destroyed and all of the books in it. Our marina is not usable and completely 80 percent destroyed. He also expects the city council to require all new construction be raised. And to protect the city, it needs a seawall on the bay side of the island. This storm has dealt us a deadly blow. Kendrick said he asked his community what it needs most. The Taiwan-based humanitarian organization Tzu Chi Foundation gave out gift cards to aid Fulton residents. He said the amounts on the cards vary depending on the family size and the need. But Chi said his group, which is rooted in Buddhism, wants to spread the word of love, stewardship of the planet and vegetarianism. Lawing added whether the people of the Coastal bend feast on real turkey or tofu turkey, they will now have plenty to be thankful for on Thanksgiving thanks to those who are helping their community recover. This area was chosen because it experienced widespread flooding during Hurricane Harvey. So, they organized a fleet of vehicles that can provide all sorts of resources like free tetanus and flu shots, food, and veterinary services.

Months later, Poteet is slowly getting the house back together. Because of this, her family is spread across the area, forcing them to delay Christmas. This is about to change. Crews are putting the finishing touches on her two FEMA mobile units. Poteet was approved for the homes in October. It took four months because of a city ordinance. But the city council recently revised it. It won't just be her. FEMA said six units are in Houston. Another 105 could be on their way soon. Once they arrive, the Houston ordinance allows homeowners to use them for six months. If they need more time, they can re-apply. The trailers don't cost homeowners anything. For Poteet, the units allow her not only a way to repair her home, but have Christmas, even if it's a couple months late. Poteet isn't moved in yet. The homes have to be properly installed. She hopes to be in the trailers by next week, and it won't just be her family visiting. We've learned Mayor Sylvester Turner plans to be here as well next week to see her new place.

Several rental properties are back open. He says he can think of 80 people whose houses are still in disrepair. And now, a small team of experts from places like the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Small Business Administration and the Smithsonian are trying to help. Teddy Reeves is one of a group of experts at tables inside a former Goodwill store in Beaumont, Texas. Collins is wearing her scrubs, and stopped at the recovery center for assistance, before going back to work at the hospital. Along with photos, she wants to save her academic materials.

The northeast Houston resident said she has homeowners insurance but her claim was denied. She then filed a claim with FEMA but that was also turned down. The Metropolitan Organization advocacy group is now encouraging Harvey victims to keep appealing if their initial claim is denied. Advocates are also recommending that people seek out a caseworker who can help with the process through a group like Baker Ripley. The Metropolitan Organization is also calling on FEMA to extend the deadline for filing those appeals. That includes walking, driving, cycling, taking the bus, and occasionally flying.

Thousands of flooded houses have been gutted, streets are lined with mounds of waterlogged debris, and it will be months before many families will be able to return home. In the Houston area alone, more than 600 households have already asked us to help get their houses cleaned out so they can begin repairs and reconstruction. Like a Weight Was Lifted A fifth-grade teacher named Paige Sherman expressed concern that the hardest-hit neighborhoods might be neglected as Houston presses forward. The house where Paige grew up and lives with her parents and son is among hundreds that flooded in the Bear Creek neighborhood west of Houston. Like many of his neighbors, he did not have flood insurance. Paige and her parents receive a Bible signed by the volunteers who worked on their home. As Harvey approached, the family moved a few valuables into second-floor bedrooms and left home for the night. When they returned, it was by boat. Water backed up behind the Addicks reservoir had risen more than a foot inside the house, ruining everything on the first floor and the two cars they had left in the driveway. In two days, the orange-shirted volunteers who had come from across Houston and as far as Florida and Maryland finished cleaning out the house, gutting the kitchen, and spraying the structure to eliminate mold. Then the crew gathered at the curbside to present the family with a new Bible signed by each volunteer. She pointed to her front porch, where her father had hung an American flag and a yard sign salvaged from the debris. Jesus Saved. Through this outreach, more than 150 individuals have prayed to receive Jesus as their Lord and Savior. Laura Krueger lives one block from Buffalo Bayou and had to be rescued by airboat during Hurricane Harvey. Countless others have seen their prayers answered and faith strengthened as God brought them through the storm. She lives one block from the Buffalo Bayou, a meandering river that drains Houston. In 17 years, it had never flooded her home. By Saturday night, she thought the worst was over. No real wind. Not that much rain. She was awakened at 5:30 a.m. by the security alarm, and when she looked down her steps, she saw her furniture floating and her living room already flooded too deep for her to escape. All she could do was climb onto a tiny second-floor balcony and wait to be rescued. From balconies on the opposite sides of the alleyway, they waited for hours in relentless rain while the churning waters rose almost to the second floor. Finally, an airboat arrived and rescued them and their cats. Laura is now living with her sister. At one point, she asked for prayers as she watched workers carried out a beloved painting of Adam and Eve being cast out of the Garden of Eden. It was obviously beyond repair. Further down the street, a family of Iranian immigrants told how this was the second time in two years that they have been flooded since they moved to Houston. Our teams shared the hope of the Gospel with them as they cleaned out their house. We praise God for the many volunteers who have served across southeastern Texas.

The homeless 52-year-old started packing what he could - his laptop, medication and one pair of pants. Before 11 a.m., the first evacuees began lining up in front of the convention center, carrying suitcases and plastic bags, some with babies on their hips and dogs on leashes. Rescue crews pulled up in pickups, dropping off families, many of whom came from Clayton Holmes, a housing complex just northeast of downtown. The overflowing bayou poured about 3 feet of water into his apartment. About 6 a.m., he started knocking on neighbors' doors to see who needed help. Police arrived about an hour later with a boat. With his family settled inside the convention center, Polson was taking the situation in stride. The Red Cross arrived to take over operations shortly after the convention center opened to evacuees. Charlie Maltbie, who was deployed from Indiana to manage the shelter, said about 1,000 evacuees were expected. Five tractor-trailers, he said, were on their way, carrying cots, blankets, food and other necessities. Hundreds arrive By noon, several hundred had arrived, including Sarah Matthews who was evacuated from an apartment in Clayton Homes where she was visiting a friend. At 6 a.m., the water was waist high at the apartment, having already washed away her computer and her 14-month-old son Braylin's stroller and playpen. Some lived downtown, and others came from nearby hotels. Marisol Burk arrived with her friend Laura Gonzalez to help the Red Cross at the George R. Brown. He biked to the convention center, going through 4 feet of water at the Watson Street bridge. With many evacuees arriving with nothing, they huddled with their families, waiting for information on what would happen next. Terranysha Ferguson and her family, draped in white towels, were grabbing snacks from volunteers after being rescued from their apartment in Clayton Homes. Walking back to her seat in the cavernous shelter building, Ferguson held her 1-year-old, Christian Phillips, who was cold and in need of a fresh diaper. By 5 p.m., more than 500 evacuees filled the shelter and more were on the way. Volunteers were checking people in and taking donations at tables just inside the doors. Jessica Archer was collecting blankets, clothes, baby supplies and other items people were bringing. Restaurants were dropping off prepared food. Resources en route Walmart was sending a truck filled including diapers, baby formula, bandages and medical supplies. Hundreds of green cots had been placed in the room where evacuees would sleep. One by one, they were laid out in tidy rows, each with their own white Red Cross blanket wrapped in plastic. U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, was at the shelter late Sunday afternoon after visiting other parts of the city. Jackson Lee said she had just spoken to the leadership of Congress about the flooding and the affected areas that are going to need money.   Several oil companies are headquartered in Houston, and oil money helped build its downtown, its priciest neighborhoods and its cultural centers. Houston has flooded each of the last three years, and while Harvey caused unprecedented damage in many neighborhoods, storms in 2015 and 2016 also displaced people and destroyed hundreds of homes. The problem has worsened because Houston lost a third of its wetlands in the last three decades, reducing places for rainwater to settle before flooding. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner talking about Harvey with PBS Newshour on Sept. 5th, 2017. Odum led Shell through a disaster of similar magnitude, the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, when an offshore rig owned by BP exploded and killed 11 people. Millions of gallons of oil spewed into the Gulf for 87 days, destroying wildlife and disrupting the lives of thousands of people along the coast. Shell was among the first companies to be allowed to resume deep-water drilling almost a year after the spill. Tanner said he watched Odum meeting with several executives of rival oil companies before they testified before Congress about the spill, in a hearing carried on national television. Turner said Odum was preparing to start a new business venture when he called asking for help, and that Odum put aside that venture. Odum will not receive a salary in his new position. He did not specify how the city would accomplish that. City and county officials have also talked about buying out homeowners in areas that are especially prone to flooding. Houston and the rest of the Texas Gulf Coast are expected to receive tens of billions of dollars in federal disaster funding, with more help coming from state government and nonprofit groups. But how that money is spent and whether city officials can affect change remains to be seen. From 1981 to 2000, the probability of 20 inches of rain happening somewhere over a large chunk of Texas was 1 in 100 or even less, Emanuel said. The study was released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Emanuel said he hurried the study to help Houston officials think about what conditions they should consider when they rebuild. To do the study Emanuel had to use some innovative modeling techniques. And in individual areas pit peaked at 60 inches (1.5 meters). Here are some statistics about the storm's impact on the state. no longer supports Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.

The maximum flood pool boundary is outlined in yellow. A low-lying neighborhood called Canyon Gate at Cinco Ranch was among the first to flood. KATY, Tex. Because Barker is normally a dry, green space, most homeowners in the neighborhood had no clue that their properties were inside an area susceptible to flooding during extreme storms. But the government acquired about 12,000 acres of that footprint and left the rest as private property. For years, this swath of prairie land remained untouched. But as the Houston area began to grow rapidly in the 1980s, developers started transforming the private land into residential neighborhoods like Canyon Gate, which is a gated community. When the corps built Barker, it constructed a basin with a 13.6-mile-long stretch of earthen dam on the eastern side of its perimeter. Waterways flow from west to east into Barker, where water is held behind the dam. The dam controls the release of water down streams and rivers that flow through Houston. On a normal day, Barker is mostly a park with horse-riding trails, and soccer and baseball fields. There are three main ways for water to flow out of the reservoir: a floodgate and two emergency spillways. When it rains, water is stored inside Barker, and then released into a meandering river called Buffalo Bayou. The government bought land in the reservoir that would be covered by water in a 100-year flood. During Hurricane Harvey, water levels rose past the government property line, flooding neighborhoods like Canyon Gate. DAM HOUSTON Maximum flood pool: 38 feet above. Government property line: 25 feet above. Areas flooded by Harvey: Up to 31.5 ft. above the lowest point of the reservoir. DAM HOUSTON Maximum flood pool: 38 ft. above.

Government property line: 25 ft. above. Numbers are approximate. But the amount discharged was not enough to keep homes behind the dams from flooding. The corps was fully aware that neighborhoods like Canyon Gate would flood. As predicted three decades earlier, a number of lawsuits have been filed against the federal government. Christina Micu, a Canyon Gate homeowner, is the lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit filed against the government. Source: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers survey of Canyon Gate on Sept. 3, 2017. It may be a while before the lawsuit is resolved.

Hurricane Harvey, one of the most destructive storms in the history of the United States, made landfall in southeast Texas on Aug. 25. The scale of the crisis is so vast, in fact, that officials concede they are nowhere near being able to measure it, much less fully address it. Below, we share a few ideas for how to begin to talk about this natural disaster with your students. As always with important breaking news, we would love to know how you will be addressing it in your classroom. And if you are a teacher or student who has been affected by Harvey, please let us know what this site might do to help. CreditAlyssa Schukar for The New York Times You might begin with Harvey in Pictures, a powerful collection of photographs about the hurricane and its aftermath. There are also videos and graphics available on the Times site and elsewhere that can help students grapple with the storm and its scope. The animated map Thousands Cried for Help offers a look at the actual requests in real time that came in to local rescue groups, and might provide an even more visceral understanding of the nature of the disaster. Post the images around the classroom, gallery-style, or project them on a whiteboard, then ask students to respond in writing or in a class discussion. You could also give students the option to write letters to people they see in these photos, or to the people affected in general. Some of the additional resources and ideas below might help.

You can also find nine lessons on hurricane anatomy, wind patterns, air pressure, heat transfer and more at the Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College. To add to that, it is in a region dotted with chemical factories, oil refineries, natural gas plants, and other potential sources of combustion and toxins. A series of small explosions shook a chemical plant northeast of Houston on Aug. 30 and more blasts were expected, after floodwaters shut down the cooling systems that kept the chemicals stable. Lead, arsenic and other toxic and carcinogenic elements may be leaching from some two dozen Superfund sites in the Houston area, reports The Times. As reporting on this region continues over the days and weeks ahead, students might attempt to answer the two questions we pose at the top of this section about what makes this city both a unique success, and uniquely complicated to fix.

Scientists are quick to point out that no single storm can be blamed on climate change. The daily surface temperature of the Gulf of Mexico last winter never dropped below 73 degrees. You can probably guess how many previous times that had happened: Zero. This sort of heat has a specific effect on storms: Warmer weather causes heavier rainfall. The severity of Harvey, in other words, is almost certainly related to climate change. Explore the evidence for climate change, including air temperature, ocean temperature, rainfall amounts and other indicators over the past century. Related Article.

I teach United States history to 11th graders at a charter school, KIPP Houston High School, which has 945 students. Most of them live in areas that are prone to flooding, and the principal is hard at work getting donations for those in need. One of my students was being evacuated when I called to check up on her. I can only imagine what she and other kids are going through right now. More than 160 public school districts and 30 charter schools in Texas have been closed. School was supposed to start next Tuesday, but the storm has put that in question. Already, over 160 school districts across Texas were closed. how you are managing. Update, Sept. 1: We have just heard from Leslie Jane Johnston, a teacher in Houston, via email. My babies are only 7. Displaced students may be assigned to my school and thus my class. I may have more students than I have chairs. That is ok with me. I will find chairs, even if I have to bring some from my home or purchase. Providing stability for them is most important to me. The lesson I want to share with my little ones is to focus on the positive impacts (masses of people and organizations putting individual differences aside and helping each other) while respectfully acknowledging the negative impacts Harvey has caused. Finally, if you are not in the Houston area, you might challenge your students to think about the issues a principal of an affected school might encounter. Related Article. They often get criticized afterward if the storm is weaker or stronger than anticipated. With Hurricane Harvey, leaders rose to the challenge in different ways. On Aug. 29, President Trump visited Corpus Christi to survey some of the damage and demonstrate a commitment to the recovery effort in the state. But he also pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff who built a national reputation for harsh conditions in his county jail, and for cracking down against undocumented immigrants, just as Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas. With Texas still being pelted by rain, a few Republicans were already relitigating that bitter fight. You might use this news as a case study in helping your students know how to determine the reliability of sources. Invite them to round up news and images from social media about Hurricane Harvey to bring in and analyze. Related Article. But an outpouring of support helped save lives during the storm and in its aftermath. Ask students what stands out for them from the footage of people escaping fast rising floodwaters. Have students relay their own experiences with crisis situations, to focus on the help they received. You might also ask them what responsibilities they believe individuals and institutions in a community have during disasters like this one. For instance, Joel Osteen, the leader of a Houston-based megachurch, was widely criticized for not opening his 16,000-seat building as a shelter. Then, have students brainstorm ways they might help, even if they live thousands of miles away. The piece continues: But certainly among the creepiest images to emerge were the rust-colored mounds formed by colonies of fire ants, the nightmarish spawn of the deadly storm that first made landfall last week and soaked South Texas with record-setting rains.

Some are about storms and floods, including Houston and New Orleans, while some are more oblique.  People were playing basketball and lifting weights. Some were even studying. They had all been hastily dropped off there by UH students, staff and faculty who, in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, needed somewhere to keep their kids. Tuesday was the first day back at class for UH, the biggest public university in a city still reeling from the hurricane that flooded miles of streets and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses. The campus just south of downtown sustained barely any damage, aside from a handful of flooded buildings that are expected to be repaired within days. But like their city, many students, faculty and staff are facing months or years of recovery. Many lost homes or cars. Almost all suffered through a hellish week during which their city practically shut down. Instead, students and staff seemed to be trying their hardest to return to normal. Many classes were near full. The line for food in the student union snaked around the building. And sororities and student groups were recruiting new members on the sidewalks. Administrators were hoping for that sense of normalcy after having to cancel the first full week of class. The childcare situation highlighted how much of a challenge that would be. Khator encouraged supervisors to allow parents to bring their children with them to work. Parents described making repeated calls for over an hour to land one of the limited spots. Once the kids arrived, the staff had to find activities for them. The children spent much of the time watching movies, drawing pictures and running around the gym. Eight classrooms and one university-run student apartment complex remain unusable. That will be a big financial hit, and will only make the semester more challenging for the mother of two. Professors have been urged to be flexible. Many of the 2,500 students who rode out the storm on campus were able to transition back to school quickly. Some faculty members, she said, are trying to figure out how to move more of their courses online. Others are temporarily homeless themselves. But amid the confusion, students and faculty said they had been inspired by the outpouring of support. More than 60 professors have offered spare rooms or other living space to colleagues who had been displaced. Dozens, she said, took those professors up on the offer. Plus many home and apartment renters were displaced due to the flooding that followed. The Landsat images show the area before and after the storm hit to show the flooded Brazos River.

The City of Houston will reimburse homeowners for Harvey-related repairs through a program the Housing Department will launch at the end of the year. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will provide the funding for the program and City officials recommend homeowners saving receipts and contracts with repair companies. There will be no limitations related to when the repairs were made. The Housing Department has posted information on the guidelines for reimbursements on its website, both in English and Spanish. The entrance is from Chartes Street. On the tour, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos made three stops, one in Port Aransas, which was hit hard by the hurricane, and two stops in Humble, northeast of Houston, where severe flooding devastated Kingwood High School. Students are expected to return then to finish out the year. During her visit to Summer Creek High, DeVos checked out sopapilla cheesecake students prepared in a culinary arts class and visited with teenagers working on Dodge Ram radiators and transmissions in auto shop. Then she toured ongoing repairs at Kingwood High, which took on several feet of water and where commercial dryers still blow.

FLOOD INSURANCE There are reports individuals must file a flood insurance claim before Friday, September 1 because a new Texas law goes into effect that day and all claims filed after Sept. 1 would be negatively impacted. Flood insurance is provided through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which was created by Congress through the passage of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. The NFIP is a federal program subject to federal law, so this new Texas state law will have no impact on NFIP policyholders. SHELTERS AND ID CHECK There are rumors undocumented immigrants cannot go to a shelter because they will be reported to ICE or CBP. 27) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have stated that they are not conducting immigration enforcement at relief sites such as shelters or food banks. In the rare instance where local law enforcement informs ICE of a serious criminal alien at a relief site that presents a public safety threat, ICE will make a determination on a case-by-case basis about the appropriate enforcement actions. The Federal Government strongly encourages all persons to follow the guidance of local officials and seek shelter regardless of their immigration status. Most shelters are managed by local communities, the Red Cross, and other voluntary agencies. The Red Cross will not ask people to show any form of identification in order to stay in their shelters.  Michael Hagerty surveys the damage and learns about plans to restore them. The gardens, located in Humble about a mile northwest of Bush Airport, are bordered by Cypress Creek, which overflowed its banks. Since then, much of the garden has been closed to visitors. The greenhouses were damaged. Many plants were swept away or suffocated under water for days. Trees were uprooted. A major new development on the grounds was washed away. And, once the waters receded, seeds from invasive species were left behind to sprout up in the days and weeks to come. Duling took Houston Matters producer Michael Hagerty on a tour of Mercer, along with Maryanne Esser, the president of The Mercer Society, and R.K. Viswanadham, a Mercer board member.   And we Houstonians are grateful for all of it. But there have apparently been some less generous comments, too. About why anyone would live at sea level, or how Houston should somehow be prepared NOT to flood, or how the whole metro area should have been evacuated. There have been comments ascribing some ideological or political motive to Harvey. And Sunday night (Aug. 27, 2017), he took to Facebook to set the record straight. The streets and many of the public parks here are designed to flood. We sit just 35 feet above sea level, and most of the city is as flat as a pool table. We average about 50 inches of rain a year. The streets and parks serve as temporary retention ponds, accommodating slow, steady drainage through our bayous. 2. We average about 50 inches of rain a year, but in the last 48 hours, many areas of greater Houston received 25 to 30 inches of rain. The drainage system, which works well in normal conditions, was overwhelmed. Even with advance notice, there was little means of preparing for this. 3. It is impossible to evacuate a city the size of Houston. The traffic jams lasted for days. One hundred people died. So far, six Houstonians have died in Hurricane Harvey, all of them (as far as I have heard) drowned in their automobiles. Houston is the bluest spot in Texas, and voted Clinton in 2016.

The reservoirs are normally dry; they include parks and trail areas, as well as parkways. The watershed area of the Addicks Dam is 136 square miles; the watershed of the Barker Dam is 130 square miles, the Army Corps says. That decision has led to criticism and legal action from residents downstream of the reservoirs. An Army Corps representative tells the Community Impact newspaper that the delay in reporting the dry reservoirs came as the agency was given legal guidance. The Addicks and Barker dams were built in the 1940s; as Houston Public Media reports, the city is now seeing movement on a long-delayed flood control project, including the construction of eight new bridges over Brays Bayou.

More than a foot of rain fell on the region, flooding dozens of neighborhoods and leaving at least five people dead in Harris County. It left its mark on a stretch of property considered some of the most valuable in the city. Joel AchenbachWashington Post Hurricane Harvey's historic deluge in Texas showed clear signs of human-caused climate change, with rainfall at least 15 percent heavier and the likelihood of such a calamity tripled, according to two independent studies published Wednesday. The new findings are part of a surge of research suggesting that communities need to revisit their vulnerability to extreme weather in a warming world. Hurricane Harvey hit the Texas coast near Corpus Christi on Aug. 25 after it intensified rapidly in the Gulf of Mexico. The storm then stalled, as if plugged in mud, and dropped record rains for the better part of a week on Southeast Texas before finally drifting north and dissipating. The storm flooded Houston and much of the region and was one of several hurricanes that impacted the United States during a volatile 2017 season, including Hurricane Irma in Florida and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. Her research found that warming likely increased the intensity of the storm's precipitation by approximately 15 percent. The second study, from researchers based at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said Harvey's precipitation was likely boosted by at least 19 percent. And that's just the lower bound; the team's best estimate, which acknowledges a great deal of uncertainty, is a 38 percent increase. The report found the likelihood of a Harvey-like event had probably increased tenfold but at the very least had tripled. When Hurricane Harvey hit and hovered for days above this city, a half-dozen school district employees manning pumps stayed at Kolter Elementary School in the flood-prone Meyerland neighborhood.

The AGU meeting is a sprawling affair in a convention center that extends for what seems like a full mile along the Mississippi River. The annual meeting is a scientific wonderland, with experts on hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes, climate change, Mars, Jupiter - you name it. The meeting has numerous sessions Wednesday devoted to late-breaking research on hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Scientific research usually takes longer to cohere, but 2017 was an astonishing year of natural disasters and many people dropped what they were doing to tease out early findings about the hurricanes and other tumult, including western U.S. wildfires. The Dutch and Berkeley research teams worked independently and used different methods - for example, examining different geographical areas, different time periods during the week that Harvey struck Texas, and framing their findings with different standards of certainty. Though their numbers are not identical, the scientists on the two teams emphasized that each study bolsters the other, with strikingly similar conclusions and lessons for the future. Health officials say the death this month of a 31-year-old Galveston man is the result of Hurricane Harvey because he was doing repair work to clean up from the storm when he contracted a flesh-eating bacterial infection. The numbers will undoubtedly change as more researchers look at this with different techniques, and perhaps different data sets and different methods. There's a truism: Climate is what you expect and weather is what you get. Weather events emerge from chaotic forces and elements, and there is variability from place to place and year to year. Scientists, and journalists reporting on weather, have typically framed their reports with caveats and cautionary notes, relying on the generalization that climate change makes events more likely but doesn't necessarily cause them. That's changing. The textbooks declare that for every degree Celsius increase in atmospheric temperature there should be 6 to 8 percent more moisture in the air. That's roughly the degree of global atmospheric warming in the past century. Wehner said he guessed, when he started his research, that Harvey might have dropped about 6 to 8 percent more rain than an identical storm would have dropped in 1950. But both the Dutch and Berkeley teams found the actual rainfall to be much higher than expected. Van der Wiel said that indicates that there is some factor, perhaps involving the dynamics of hurricanes, that results in additional precipitation - beyond what you'd expect for the greater atmospheric moisture. This is not the first time scientists have said an extreme weather event has a signal of climate change. Wehner said the 2010 Texas drought was an event twice as likely due to climate change. And floods in September 2013 in Colorado came after rainfall that was 30 percent heavier that should be expected, he said.

When it receded, it left behind wet walls, ruined floors, mold and at least one damaged foundation. And of course, the bookmobiles show up at parks, schools, churches and community centers. But the libraries themselves linger, waiting for repair work or rebuilding. The good news: Two branches should reopen before the end of 2018, Middleton said. At least one neighborhood library will be closed until late 2019, he said. Another handful remain in limbo, with no reopening date in sight. Ginter helped evacuate people from their flooded neighborhood near the Buffalo Bayou. John Sharp, who leads the commission charged with overseeing Harvey recovery efforts, said the report would evolve as the state continued to work with local official to document their needs. In the aftermath of the storm, Sharp asked local officials in areas hit by Harvey to document their needs. The commission then reviewed their requests with a panel of experts to compile the report. According to the report, local officials were instructed to focus on infrastructure, not housing needs, which will receive funding separately through a grant program from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Abbott appointed Sharp, who is the chancellor of Texas A&M University and a former legislator, railroad commissioner and state comptroller, to oversee the commission in early September.

In the year since Harvey, McKinney and his colleagues at the Texas A&M Corpus Christi interdisciplinary institute continue to research how both humans and nature reacted and adapted to the storm. Still, McKinney said, Harvey serves as a reminder of the resiliency of nature and how coastal bays and estuaries have evolved to benefit from seasonal storms. For coastal ecosystems, Harvey offered a welcome and necessary flush of freshwater to bays and estuaries. The rainfall was like stirring up a big pot, McKinney said, freeing sediment and nutrients that had been trapped in riverbeds and letting nutrient-rich waters flow to the coast. As those plankton die, their decomposing bodies use up valuable oxygen in the estuary ecosystem. But now, McKinney said, the nutrients remaining after the plankton bloom are fueling fish and other small creature populations. Beaches and plant life were also rejuvenated in the aftermath of the storm, said Tom Schmid, CEO of the Texas State Aquarium. Researchers from the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies travel by airboat to take water samples of the Nueces River near Corpus Christi. When hurricanes hit and you get flooding canals and houses, the same thing happens to the natural community. As the hurricane stalled out over Houston, it dumped enough freshwater at once into the Gulf to become toxic. Through models and satellite images, scientists were able to watch the mass of freshwater as it spread more than 100 miles offshore. The two research teams were among 59 across the country given grants to study the immediate impacts of the storm. I think animals have an amazing ability to recover from events like this.

At that moment, in a dry neighborhood across town, a few dozen residents were enjoying brunch at Pax Americana: Brisket hash, honey-butter chicken, cold mimosas. More than a week after the worst disaster in state history, Houston officials and residents began confronting a city of contrasts: Between those spared by Harvey, and those still in crisis. Between aiding people in need, and returning to business as usual. Between starting the rebuilding process, and pausing to reconsider the cost of unmitigated development. The transit system is up and running. Those words ring true in swaths of the region, where residents unaffected by Harvey's floodwaters have begun a gradual return to normalcy. A family shopped for a new TV in the Galleria area. A teenager mowed grass in Cypress. A line of vehicles waited at a self-serve car wash in Bellaire. Meanwhile, Harvey's body count continued to grow, up to nearly 60 by Sunday evening. Yet more are expected to be found as water recedes from flooded homes. Earlier in the week, she'd been delivering free meals to displaced residents and rescuers. Rebuilding under way More than 1,000 people continued to shelter at the George R. Brown Convention Center, down significantly from the 10,000-person peak a week earlier. Another 2,600 or so remained at NRG Center. Those still there likely will be the hardest to relocate, officials said, either because their homes were damaged beyond repair, or because floodwaters still haven't subsided. He arrived at the shelter nine days earlier after losing his Spring Branch apartment. The government effort to find longer-term solutions is underway. The Federal Emergency Management Agency opened its first Disaster Recovery Center in Houston on Sunday, at the north end of the George R. Brown. The agency is working to identify locations for additional centers, where residents affected by Harvey will be able to apply for aid, ask questions or resolve problems in person, said agency spokesman Peter Herrick Jr. Turner on Sunday also talked about the need to get displaced residents back in their houses as fast as possible. He said he asked President Donald Trump a day earlier to double federal funding for a program that helps residents rapidly repair and return to flood-damaged homes. In Austin, Gov. Greg Abbott seemed to pump the brakes on the rush to rebuild, calling for new development restrictions in order to prevent future flooding disasters. In the past, local plans to limit and control storm runoff have been sidetracked by high costs and opposition from business and development interests in a city without zoning controls. Waiting and watching Many residents across huge swaths of Texas remain in crisis. In Crosby, the Harris County Fire Marshal's office set off the remaining six containers of volatile chemicals at Arkema's plant Sunday afternoon, days after the plant flooded and lost a complex cooling system that kept the chemicals from exploding. But it was unclear late Sunday when residents who live near the plant would be allowed to go home. Hundreds living within 1.5 miles had evacuated earlier in the week. In Beaumont, where homes remain flooded and residents were cut off from city water late Sunday, the Coast Guard continued rescuing people, including four boaters earlier in the day who'd run out of fuel and were drifting aimlessly along the overwhelmed Neches River. Across Texas, about 37,000 storm evacuees were staying at more than 270 shelters, where FEMA has so far dished out 4.7 million meals and 18 million cups of water. Many millions more will be needed in the coming months. In a Sunday morning update, FEMA officials said Trump's approval of disaster assistance cleared the way for the federal government to pick up 90 percent of the cost of debris removal, a gargantuan task that officials anticipate will strain area landfills and heavy haul trucking companies for months. LIVE MAP: Where you can do the most good Residents who spent the week gutting their flooded homes were less worried about debris removal than finding a way to return to normal. Lary Tillmon sat on a camping chair in the driveway of his flood-damaged home in Independence Heights, behind a mound of possessions, ripped and sodden on the street. The least of his problems. Music played through his speakerphone as he sat on hold, waiting for a FEMA representative to pick up. He sighed, thinking about the loss of his home. About paperwork issues holding up his application for FEMA aid. He glanced back at his phone screen, still on hold. Waiting. Maggie Gordon and Lindsay Ellis contributed to this report.

Houston Matters producer Joshua Zinn finds out more about the survey from with Pablo Pinto, director of the Center for Public Policy at the School of Public Affairs. Two research groups found that the record rainfall as Harvey stalled over Texas in late August, which totaled more than 50 inches in some areas, was as much as 38 percent higher than would be expected in a world that was not warming. While many scientists had said at the time that Harvey was probably affected by climate change, because warmer air holds more moisture, the size of the increase surprised some. Based on how much the world has warmed, Dr. Wehner said, before the analysis he had expected an increase of only about 6 or 7 percent. Geert Jan van Oldenborgh of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and the lead author of the second study, said that climate change also made such an extreme rainstorm much more likely. Image Hurricane Harvey on August 25. By the time it reached Houston it had weakened to a tropical storm, but it moved slowly over the region, rotating and picking up more moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Thousands of homes and businesses in the region were flooded and more than 80 people died. Antonia Sebastian, a researcher at Rice University and a co-author of the World Weather Attribution paper, said that Harvey was a much larger event than governments and developers normally plan and build for. In August, a week before Hurricane Harvey, President Trump rolled back an Obama-era executive order that included climate change and sea-level rise in federal flood risk standards. Both studies were released during the annual meeting here of the American Geophysical Union, a large gathering of leading climate researchers and other earth scientists. Image Evacuating homes in Houston during the flooding from Hurricane Harvey. The studies are the latest in a series of analyses that search for the fingerprints of climate change on individual weather events like storms or heat waves. Despite overwhelming evidence that the climate is changing overall because of greenhouse gases emissions, for years most scientists had said it was extremely difficult to link warming to specific events. That has now changed, with studies in recent years that found that climate change affected Australian heat waves in 2013, downpours in Louisiana in 2016, floods in France that same year and many other events.

But he's also made an effort to woo them on the radio and in print. Above-average rainfall in recent years has filled reservoirs that many cities depend on for drinking water, he said. Climate change is driving the extreme swings in rainfall totals, said State Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon. While annual rainfall totals may not change much overall, he said climate models show that storms will become less frequent and more intense. And those dry spells will be worse, too, thanks to higher temperatures, which bring more evaporation, he added. Chemical plants and oil refineries spewed millions of pounds of toxic chemicals into the air and on the ground after Hurricane Harvey struck Texas a year ago. The analysis, from the Environmental Integrity Project, looks at mandatory pollution reports companies filed. It found that something went wrong when it came to the monitoring and managing of toxic emissions during Harvey. Here are some of the findings. Many petrochemical plants waited too long before they shut down. That was the right call, according to the report. In other cases, facilities in and around Houston were damaged or even destroyed, causing greater harm to the environment and public health. The report urges preemptive, better-coordinated closures at vulnerable plants to stop this from happening. Officials should have better communicated the danger of toxic emissions. Harvey caused at least 8.3 million pounds of unpermitted air pollution from petrochemical plants, much of it dangerous to humans. The report finds that officials should better monitor and communicate the risk of air pollution. Facilities need to develop safer storage for dangerous chemicals. Burned-out trailers sit at the Arkema chemical plant in Crosby, Texas, after Harvey flooded the plant and caused organic peroxides stored in the trailers to catch fire. At least 15 of those storage tanks failed during Harvey, spilling pollutants. That includes improving the storage of dangerous chemicals. The report comes as the EPA begins its own investigation into the state and federal monitoring of air pollution during and after Hurricane Harvey.

Mexico City, Parched and Sinking, Faces a Water Crisis Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor. Water drains naturally in this stretch of Texas, or at least it used to. At more than 600 square miles, Houston has grown to be as big as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia combined, a giant spread of asphalt smothering many of the floodplains that once shuttled water from the prairies to the sea. When finished, the newest road to ring the city and propel its expansion, called the Grand Parkway, will encircle an area equivalent to all of Rhode Island. For years, the local authorities turned a blind eye to runaway development. Thousands of homes have been built next to, and even inside, the boundaries of the two big reservoirs devised by the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1940s after devastating floods. Back then, Houston was 20 miles downstream, its population 400,000. Today, these reservoirs are smack in the middle of an urban agglomeration of six million. We have bridged the continent with railways and roads, erected cities in the desert, and changed the course of rivers. Built on a mosquito-infested Texas swamp, Houston similarly willed itself into a great city. Its sprawl of highways and single-family homes is a postwar version of the American dream. Unfortunately, nature always gets the last word. The very forces that pushed the city forward are threatening its way of life. Sprawl is only part of the story. Houston is also built on an upbeat, pro-business strategy of low taxes and little government. Many Texans regard this as the key to prosperity, an antidote to Washington. It encapsulates a potent vision of an unfettered America. Harvey called that concept into question. It may have been an unusually bad hurricane, dumping trillions of gallons of water in a few days, even more to the east of the city than to the west, in the prairie, and setting all kinds of records. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Cypress Creek Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Buffalo Bayou Barker Reservoir Buildings Damaged by Hurricane Harvey Brays Bayou Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Buildings Damaged By Hurricane Harvey Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Barker Reservoir Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Cypress Creek Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Barker Reservoir Buffalo Bayou Brays Bayou Buildings Damaged By Hurricane Harvey Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. Global warming may not specifically have caused Harvey, any more than a single major league home run can be attributed to steroids. That said, scientists have little doubt that climate change is making storms worse and more frequent. Coming right after those events, Harvey has led even some pro-development enthusiasts to rethink the city and its surroundings. Mexico City, Parched and Sinking, Faces a Water Crisis Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point. Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor. A self-described traditional Republican and big backer of the Grand Parkway, Judge Emmett had planned on spending his twilight years in public service saving the Houston Astrodome from demolition. Harvey altered that. Now he thinks his mission is to protect the entire region. After every natural calamity, American politicians make big promises. They say: We will rebuild. We will not be defeated. Never again will we be caught unprepared. But they rarely tackle the toughest obstacles. Resettling neighborhoods, making certain places off-limits to development, creating dikes and reservoirs is difficult, both financially and politically. It takes longer than most election cycles. Memories fade. Inertia sets in. Residents just want to get their lives back to normal. Politicians want votes, not trouble. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans, for better and worse, used its cataclysm as an opportunity to reboot, not just fixing levees but overhauling public schools, hospitals and many neighborhoods. It was a wrenching process. The mere suggestion of moving people out of vulnerable neighborhoods set off bitter protests, causing the city to back down from some of its most sweeping proposals. Texas after Harvey is no different, and perhaps even less prepared to change. Like the rest of America, it is deeply divided between urban and rural, Democrat and Republican. Houston is a blue city with a black mayor in a bright red state. Ultimately, though, any resolution will require that everyone face the same threats together. The spread of asphalt and concrete has inhibited rainwater from draining naturally in Houston. When finished, the Grand Parkway, above, on the edge of Houston, will encircle an area equivalent to all of Rhode Island. He remembers escaping years ago to the prairie to bird watch. One recent morning he drove me out there along the Grand Parkway and pulled into an unfinished subdivision. The development, she said, adheres to county standards requiring that houses be raised above the 100-year floodplain. The woman handed Mr. Blackburn a glossy brochure and a disclaimer, which he scanned before climbing back into the car, shaking his head. The disclaimer explained that roads outside the development, linking it to the parkway, occupy the 10-year floodplain, meaning they would have about a 10 percent chance of flooding every year. But that requires politicians to agree. An upbeat narrative casts business-friendly Texas in the loner role of swashbuckling cowboy, disdainful of coastal elites. He believes cities are the culprit. For years, Texas Republicans promoted local controls to push against federal court orders on issues like desegregation and same-sex marriage. Now state leaders have made a U-turn. Little wonder, post-Harvey, that state and local officials have anointed different flood and recovery czars. Texas is sounding these days like Russia under the Romanovs. The system ensures nobody is clearly in charge. Least of all in Houston. Two other bills to study flooding in the Houston region, introduced in the last legislative session, died in committee. I met with the mayor in City Hall at the time. He noted that the Legislature had convened a special session to ban gender-neutral bathrooms. Another official, this one with the county, made the point that the area around Houston is a patchwork of counties and municipalities with different rules and no coordination because Texans believed the upside of what became, in essence, institutionalized entropy was that it allowed residents to avoid the encumbrances of city governments, regulations and taxes. The problem is that hurricanes and floods, worsened by climate change, do not recognize political borders or county lines. Their toll is shared by everyone. The hypocrisy of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, resisting federal aid to the New York region after Hurricane Sandy but then requesting it for Texas after Harvey, is in fact part of this same history. Bruce Hooper, outside his home in Kashmere Gardens in Houston, would like to move but has no place to go. Before it elected Mr. Turner, it elected a mayor who was a lesbian. The city is in thrall to cars and highways and has precious little mass transit, but the municipality of Houston relies more on renewable energy than any other big city in America. Houston has more green space, relative to paved, than New York. They insist that its business-friendly, light-on-regulations approach helps account for a big rise in employment since 2000. Decades later, Houston boasts of becoming the most diverse big city in the country, with comparatively low housing costs that translate to higher levels of minority homeownership. Harris County officials say they have received as many requests for buyouts since the hurricane (3,000) as there have been buyouts since the mid-1990s. Harvey turned out to be an equal opportunity disaster. They are among the homeowners hoping for a buyout. Buying out rich homes to repurpose vulnerable areas like Meyerland for flood detention, as Mr. Sacks notes, would require loads of money and remove valuable properties from tax rolls in a county that relies on property taxes. Bruce Hooper would move, too. During Harvey, he woke up to crackling sounds, when floodwaters started to seep into his appliances and electrical outlets. Mr. Hooper lives in a poor area called Kashmere Gardens. I found him sitting on a tattered lawn chair outside the shell of his tumbledown rental. An unemployed former parks employee, Mr. Hooper told me that he and his family of five had to be airlifted out by the Coast Guard after a detention pond overflowed and water inside the house rose from ankle to chest high in an hour. The Kahans own a single-story home in a middle-class neighborhood, Bear Creek Village. Christine Kahan and her husband had lived for 28 years in their house without a flood. Now Ms. Kahan said she would entertain a buyout. A part-time real-estate agent, she advises clients to think twice about buying any home that flooded. Hers is now one of them. But Mr. Kahan says they will stay, for the time being. I asked how that lined up with his desire not to leave Bear Creek. One afternoon I biked with Guy Hagstette around Buffalo Bayou Park. The Allen brothers were real estate swindlers from New York who founded Houston in 1836. After oil turned up beneath the muck and clay, they seemed like prophets. It collapsed riverbanks and left dunes of silt that buried pedestrian paths, playgrounds and fields. He meant not just repairing and fortifying the park, but also adapting Houston to the new normal. For starters, that will require fresh numbers. Harris County demands that new developments retain enough rainwater on site to neutralize the effects of a 100-year storm. But those 100-year numbers date back years. They are based on mitigating a storm that averages 13.2 inches of rain in 24 hours. Harvey brought 25.9 inches in 24 hours. The Memorial Day flood dropped 11 inches in three hours. The Tax Day flood dumped 17 inches in 12 hours in the Katy Prairie. As meteorologist for the Harris County Flood Control District, Mr. Lindner spent five sleepless days and nights during Harvey as an unshakable, tousled expert in a blue, button-down shirt, going on television and providing Houstonians with useful information. We met at the flood control district office one morning. Mr. Blackburn tells a story about a local hero, Jesse Jones, the former secretary of commerce, who helped secure federal funds for the ship channel. In 1929, Mr. Jones convinced fellow Houston bankers to put aside reserves of cash that prevented city banks from failing in the Depression. What may save Houston today, Mr. Blackburn said, is another common-sense strategy involving stricter controls and infrastructural investments that somehow lets state Republicans acquiesce behind closed doors but beat their chests in public. A hurricane that pushes a massive storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico into Galveston Bay, up the ship channel, could overwhelm refineries and unleash a toxic tsunami, killing many and rattling the national economy. The judge and mayor are among those talking about a so-called Ike Dike, named after Hurricane Ike in 2008, which killed dozens in Texas. It would be a massive sea-gate that could block a surge. The scale and engineering would be Texas-size. The cost would be, too. Judge Emmett asked, rhetorically, when we met in his office. Urban sprawl is only part of the story of Houston. The city was also built on an upbeat, pro-business strategy of low taxes and little government. Map by Ford Fessenden. Source: FEMA preliminary damage estimates. We would love to hear from you. Ginter helped evacuate people from their flooded neighborhood near the Buffalo Bayou. Local leaders and flood control planners are learning that 500-year floods may become regular occurrences. Four months after Harvey stormed ashore and dumped historic rains on the coastal flatlands, major questions remain. So far, the state is leaning hard on the federal government to fix what Harvey broke. Texas leaders would like more. Jury trials resumed October 16, but the backlog in pending cases persists. Judges continue to double up on courtrooms, with trial courts allocated on a rotating basis. Court officials said proceedings are not likely to return to normal until the facilities are restored to full occupancy, which could take as long as another year and will cost tens of millions of dollars. But the justice system is slowly coming back to life: Cases are being heard, albeit slowly, and verdicts are being handed down. Well over 5,000 people already have reported for jury duty. The state has a list of big-ticket infrastructure projects for flood mitigation and prevention. Buyouts: After three flood events in three years, lots of Houstonians are talking about buyouts. About a month after Harvey struck, more than 24,000 families were living in FEMA-funded hotel rooms; that number dropped to about 11,300 families by mid-December as homes were repaired, renters found new apartments and others found better long-term housing options. More than 90,000 people have filed insurance claims through the National Flood Insurance Program, also managed by FEMA. But for many Harvey victims, recovery will be measured in years.

And Houston Matters producer Maggie Martin talks with David Conrad, a policy consultant with the Association of State Floodplain Managers who has worked with the federal government on flood-related projects. Conrad says before Harvey there was another major disaster that was pivotal in shaping flood policy. For some, seeing their home for the first time is more emotional than they expected. While the storm has dissipated, water remains in many homes. People are starting to return to the Nottingham Forest subdivision, an upscale area located just north of Buffalo Bayou, which has been heavily flooded. Homes that are closer to the bayou had anywhere from 2 to 5 feet of flooded water on Thursday. A lot of that flooding resulted from a controlled release of water from nearby reservoirs. Families are going back into the area to check on their homes, trying to salvage as much as possible. People are in kayaks and boats, but the water currents could be strong, almost to the point of needing a motor boat to navigate. Bret Hinkie, a Houston-area commercial airline pilot is driving boats for people in need. He gets calls from people all over Houston who want to be taken to their homes and then picked up after gathering their belongings. Hinkie said most people are looking for valuables and family heirlooms when they return home, fearing that looters may steal them. Other items were more sentimental. Hinkie had been working in other areas in the city earlier this week but ended up in Nottingham Forrest because his high school friend, Scott McKnight, asked for his help. The McKnight family, who was flooded out in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, has about almost 3 feet of water in their home. On the north side of Interstate 10 from Buffalo Bayou, a reservoir that runs along Barker Cypress road has flooded. Residents wait to get on boats or Jet Skis to be taken back to their homes to try to retrieve things or check the damage. The Texas Department of State Health Services said Monday that water contamination from household chemicals and possibly industrial chemicals could be a problem. After checking in on their homes, even when the water was waist-deep, residents secured their doors. Some strapped locks on the outside to avoid looters. On Tuesday, as many as 14 people accused of looting had been arrested, according to Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg. Houston-based photographer Scott Dalton contributed to this reporting.

For now, no one on Capitol Hill seems inclined to increase the misery of those affected in Houston by drastically changing the flood insurance program for those who are currently filing claims. As Houston works to recover from Harvey, drivers are seeing lots of congestion. We looked at one of the reasons why. Some major north-south routes are closed, like North Eldridge and Dairy Ashford.

For years, there have been warnings. Now, measures like a third reservoir in west Harris County have a new urgency. For Texas to pay for those alone, it would need to spend virtually all of the Rainy Day Fund, which may explain why the Legislature has put off work on these projects for so long. It had also wasted a tremendous opportunity. State Senator Borris Miles says that may be what leads Texas lawmakers to pony up their share for flood infrastructure, in addition to the federal dollars. The problem is that the next legislative session is still more than a year away.

Texas churches and other religious institutions damaged by Hurricane Harvey now have a chance to secure federal disaster recovery funds thanks to a new policy unveiled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency this week. The change is being applauded by state leaders and churches that had been pushing for access to the funds. Two Florida synagogues filed a similar lawsuit. Hi-Way Tabernacle, the Harvest Family Church in Cypress and the Rockport First Assembly of God argued that they should qualify for federal funds to help pay for property losses incurred during the storm. The First Assembly of God lost its steeple, roof, and church van, while the other two churches were severely flooded. The Hi-Way Tabernacle also operated as an emergency shelter and aid distribution center in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, according to the lawsuit. Not all religious groups are likely to support the new policy. While the federal government is allowed to reimburse religious groups for the secular emergency services they provide, publicly funding the repair of church buildings is improper, they argued. Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the American Civil Liberties Union joined them in their amicus brief opposing the lawsuit.

That fact is increasingly clear, even though the rains are still falling and the water levels in Houston are still rising. Now is the time to say it as loudly as possible: Harvey is what climate change looks like. Story Continued Below Houston has been sprawling out into the swamp for decades, largely unplanned and unzoned. Houston, as it was before Harvey, will never be the same again. Harvey is the third 500-year flood to hit the Houston area in the past three years, but Harvey is in a class by itself. By the time the storm leaves the region on Wednesday, an estimated 40 to 60 inches of rain will have fallen on parts of Houston. So much rain has fallen already that the National Weather Service had to add additional colors to its maps to account for the extreme totals. For most of the Houston area, in a stable climate, a rainstorm like Harvey is not expected to happen more than once in a millennium. In fact, Harvey is likely already the worst rainstorm in U.S. history. Harvey ranks at the top of the list, with a total rainwater output equivalent to 3.6 times the flow of the Mississippi River. Harvey is now the benchmark disaster of record in the United States. As with Katrina, Harvey gives us an opportunity for an inflection point as a society. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Climate change is making rainstorms everywhere worse, but particularly on the Gulf Coast. Since the 1950s, Houston has seen a 167 percent increase in the frequency of the most intense downpours. Climate scientist Kevin Trenberth thinks that as much as 30 percent of the rainfall from Harvey is attributable to human-caused global warming. That means Harvey is a storm decades in the making. One recent study showed that by mid-century, up to 450 million people worldwide will be exposed to a doubling of flood frequency. This is happening all over. A warmer atmosphere enhances evaporation rates and increases the carrying capacity of rainstorms. Harvey drew its energy from a warmer-than-usual Gulf of Mexico, which will only grow warmer in the decades to come. At its peak, on Saturday night, Harvey produced rainfall rates exceeding six inches per hour in Houston, and its multiday rainfall total is close to the theoretical maximum expected for anywhere in the United States. Some scientists have linked this to melting Arctic sea ice, which reduces the strength of the polar jet stream and weakens atmospheric steering currents that can otherwise dip down and kick a storm like Harvey on its way. To be sure, a storm like Harvey might have been possible in the absence of climate change, but there are many factors at play that almost assuredly made it more likely. Politics How Washington Made Harvey Worse By MICHAEL GRUNWALD Adapting to a future in which a millennium-scale flood can wipe out a major city is much harder than preventing that flood in the first place. There were many people in Houston already working on making that world a reality even before Harvey came. Those of us who know this need to say it loudly. As long as our leaders, in words, and the rest of us, in actions, are OK with incremental solutions to a civilization-defining, global-scale problem, we will continue to stumble toward future catastrophes. The weather has always been political. The choices of how to do that, by definition, are political ones. Institutionalized climate denial in our political system and climate denial by inaction by the rest of us have real consequences. They look like Houston. The rebuilding process provides an opportunity to chart a new path. The choice is between success and failure.

Read the studies inside. Researchers also said global warming often goosed aspects of two other destructive hurricanes this year, Irma and Maria. Findings were discussed Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans. The Harvey studies used a combination of established and new techniques. An international team used computer simulations and decades of past observations to estimate the odds for the record rainfall that came with Harvey over a period of three days in August with and without global warming. By comparing those two, they concluded global warming tripled the likelihood for the deluge, which reached more than 50 inches in one location. Most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases gets absorbed by oceans and that energy serves as fuel for hurricanes and other storms. The ocean heat content was record high in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere before Harvey hit. If it had been lower, there would have been much less rain, he said.

Even before the Harvey made landfall late Friday, dozens of oil and gas platforms had been evacuated, at least three refineries had closed and at least two petrochemical plants had suspended operations. How soon they reopen depends on the severity of flooding and the resumption of power to the areas. But they believe gas prices will increase 5 cents to 25 cents per gallon. Harvey also continued to take a toll on U.S. air travel Saturday, with more than 1,000 flight cancellations as of the early evening, according to FlightAware. The shipping industry also is expected to be disrupted by the worst hurricane to hit the refinery-rich Texas coast in more than 50 years. Several refineries at greatest risk of suffering a direct strike from high winds have already shut down, but it is the potential for flooding in the Houston and Beaumont areas that could really pinch gasoline supplies. Flooding and power outages caused by a storm surge are considered the biggest risk. For now, Lipow is predicting gasoline prices will rise 10 cents per gallon east of the Rockies. Flint Hills Resources announced that it would shutter a refinery before Harvey hit and Valero Energy Corp. said it was closing two facilities in Corpus Christi. In addition to the refinery closures, Formosa Plastics shut its petrochemical plant in Point Comfort, Texas, and OxyChem suspended operations at its petrochemical plant in Ingleside, Texas, according to Platts, an S&P Global division that tracks the commodities and energy industry. As of Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said workers had been removed from 86 of the 737 manned platforms used to pump oil and gas from beneath the Gulf. The agency estimated that platforms accounting for about 22 percent of oil production and 23 percent of natural gas output in the Gulf had been shut down. But, she noted, oil companies announced fewer platform shutdowns on Friday than they had on Thursday, which is an encouraging sign. Exxon Mobil closed two of its platforms and was evacuating all personnel in the expected path of the storm, said spokeswoman Suann Guthrie. On shore, ConcoPhillips stopped all operations in the Eagle Ford shale formation, which lies across a swath of South Texas inland from the Gulf. A company spokeswoman cited safety and potential disruptions in getting oil and gas from the wells to market during the storm. Port operations in Corpus Christi and Galveston closed, and the port of Houston said container terminals and general cargo facilities closed around midday Friday. Rates for carrying freight between the Gulf of Mexico and the U.S. East Coast rose. Airlines were offering customers the chance to reschedule trips that would take them to Houston, San Antonio or Austin from Friday through the weekend. They said the hardest-hit areas will include Corpus Christi, which is on the coast, and San Antonio, which is about 140 miles inland. Risk Management Solutions Inc. said losses from storm surges and inland flooding could be a bigger source of losses. If the firm is correct, that would put homeowners and the government-backed National Flood Insurance Program at risk. School administrators have argued that all schools in the disaster area should automatically get waivers. The nonprofit organization Texas Folklife has a program called Stories From Deep in the Heart, which trains young people in Texas schools to produce audio documentaries.

(Tom O'Connor) Dozens of city firefighters traveled more than 1,500 miles to hand out Christmas presents in Texas to children whose families are still recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Harvey. Many of the firefighters traveling to the Lone Star State had been part of the recovery effort in late August when Harvey made landfall along the Texas coast. Batts and her brother Alvin are unable to return home and may have to go to an area shelter.

Harvey, which made landfall north of Corpus Christi late Friday evening, is expected to dump upwards to 40 inches of rain in Texas over the next couple of days. The plant, about 25 miles northeast of Houston, lost power and its backup generators amid Harvey's dayslong deluge, leaving it without refrigeration for chemicals that become volatile as the temperature rises.

The Breeze was the last of four ships to dock in the Port of Galveston's cruise terminal after being turned away Friday as Harvey strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane. The cruise was originally supposed to end Sunday, and was given clearance to dock early Saturday. Both of the Martinez's had family members suffer losses in the storm. Those on board not from the afflicted areas were given a chance to disembark in New Orleans, where the ship docked twice, but Carnival advised against it, citing the inaccessibility of roads approaching Houston and Galveston. Though they were unable to make port, Knuckles said, the crew went to great lengths to make the extended stay comfortable with free wifi, phone calls and a continuation of all-inclusive amenities like food and entertainment.

Then Harvey Came. Image Leslie Martinez, right; her husband, John Ahearn; and their daughter, Alex Ahearn, outside their home, which flooded after Hurricane Harvey despite being outside the official flood plain in The Woodlands, Tex. CreditIlana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times By John Schwartz, James Glanz and Andrew W. Lehren Dec. 2, 2017 THE WOODLANDS, Tex. They rushed across the lawn, seeped around the doors and into the house. It was 2:15 a.m. on Aug. 28, three days after Hurricane Harvey made landfall. Her young daughter was asleep in her arms. They would never have bought here otherwise. Flood insurance, of course, was neither required nor needed. Now, with the rains outside lashing and the water inside rising, the family and their terrified pet, a one-eyed goldendoodle named Coco, took refuge on the second floor. Later that day, rescue boats came and ferried them to safety. It left them feeling furious and betrayed. CreditIlana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times What they did not know was that their home, and those of many of their flooded-out neighbors in this new section of The Woodlands, had been built on land that not long ago lay squarely, and sometimes soggily, in a flood plain. What they had done, in effect, was create gerrymandered maps of risk. Other lots in their area were raised as little as 1.2 inches above that height. No one has suggested that the developers broke any laws, and the company that owns The Woodlands says it followed all applicable regulations and standards. But the experiences of the family of Ms. Martinez and their neighbors show that even when the mapping rules are followed to the letter, the results can be disastrous. The adjustment process began as a way to correct the wild inaccuracies in the maps that form the basis of the federal flood-insurance program, which was created in the 1960s to protect homeowners from catastrophic loss. Increasingly, though, the changes have also become a way for developers to build on low-lying land. Across the country, documents show, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the insurance program, has granted more than 150,000 map changes in the last five years. In some cases, lots were raised, and in others, levees, drainage systems, water-detention ponds and other methods changed the calculated flood risk for a swath of land. Many of these changes were unquestionably appropriate. But in the Houston area, a Times analysis of FEMA documents shows, at least 6,000 properties in redesignated zones were damaged during the flooding caused by Harvey. If The Woodlands was a community apart, rich with woods, lakes, trails and streams, Mr. Mitchell was its benevolent dictator, whose vision of building quality and environmental balance fostered a reputation of a development where the flood risk was extremely low. Don Hickey, a 37-year resident of The Woodlands who was an early employee of Mr. Mitchell, said people paid more to live here in part because they felt they would be safe. The company says there has been no slippage of quality through the transition of ownership. Hurricane Harvey, the company argues, was an exceptional flooding event, and all map revisions followed federal and local guidelines. Boundaries of Risk The National Flood Insurance Program and the flood maps used to establish the need for insurance have been a constant source of controversy. The risk is defined by law, not nature: FEMA and the flood insurance program look to what is known as 100-year flood elevation to determine who needs to buy insurance. Anything lower than that is considered to be in the flood plain. Above that level, supposedly, is safety. The 100-year flood level does not mean a flood will happen only once every 100 years. Instead, it refers to a 1 percent chance of flooding in any given year. That 1 percent chance actually translates into a one-in-four chance of a flood occurring at least once during the life of a 30-year mortgage. And in Houston, as in many parts of the country, 100-year floods are distressingly common. The Houston area saw three such events in the past three years. Climate change threatens to make them even more likely. To Mr. Blackburn, the 100-year line is too arbitrary for comfort. By the 1980s, he said, the agency, too overwhelmed and underfinanced to make all the corrections itself, instituted new procedures for accepting revised elevation data from engineers hired by aggrieved citizens. Developers have taken advantage of the new system as well, FEMA documents show, with a range of techniques from hiring surveyors to correct elevations to building structures like levees and drainage channels. Harris County, home to large parts of suburban Houston, including the newer sections of The Woodlands, is one of a handful of districts around the nation that FEMA has granted a sort of shared authority in approving map revisions. What the county has done is put a great deal of effort, and expense, into creating special software model for more accurately calculating flooding risks and the wider effects of development in the relatively flat terrain of the Houston area, Mr. Hannan said. In the business of flood-map revision, the pressure usually runs one way. There is seldom much local interest in having a neighborhood declared flood prone, said Sarah Pralle, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University who studies the politics of flood insurance and has written about lobbying efforts by New York and New Orleans to alter the maps. But it was not until the years leading up to 2011, when the Hughes Corporation put together the final pieces of its purchase of The Woodlands, that the housing market caught up with the plan. Houston shook off the wreckage of the subprime mortgage crisis and encountered a very different problem: a shortage of housing on the high end of the market. Touching off the surge in demand was an announcement by Exxon that it was opening a new corporate campus in nearby Spring. Exxon was far from alone, as a growing list of companies relocated to the area. So did tens of thousands of workers, drawn by the boom in fracking technologies that none other than Mr. Mitchell and colleagues had coaxed, tweaked and perfected over nearly 20 years. That influx would have all but saturated the existing home market, said Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It drove a spike in land prices, allowing developers to consider new construction on relatively low-cost lots that previously would have been too costly to improve. Building right along the creek would have been out of the question, but farther south, portions of the land were slightly above the 100-year flood plain, according to the maps. Those who knew the land and its history saw warning signs. By bringing in thousands of dump truck loads of dirt, it would be possible to expand the acreage above the flood plain, making the whole area suitable for construction. That is exactly what The Woodlands decided to do, documents show. The former edges of the flood plain run through what are now the lots of Ms. Martinez and Mr. Hickey, the longtime Woodlands resident who once worked for Mr. Mitchell and had built a new home in the neighborhood. FEMA approved a map change for that area on Feb. 8, 2011, documents show. On June 13, 2013, FEMA approved a map change for what would become lots for the 81 homes in those areas. The result: neighborhoods that seemed safe from flooding. Initially, the agent warned that the policy would be very expensive; the house was in a flood plain, she said. Mr. Soeder, who knew he had bought a home at the 500-year elevation, asked her to check again. Mr. Hickey dug into damage statistics and found that his recently constructed neighborhood flooded at far higher rates than others in The Woodlands. Yet among homes built in more recent years in Harris County, 331 out of 4,993 flooded, or more than 6 percent. Mr. Hickey questioned whether adequate measures had been taken in the fill project to provide water storage and drainage in big storms. Marc Crudgington, who bought his home the year after Ms. Martinez and her husband did, voiced similar concerns. This task force was actually formed last year in response to previous flooding, and little had been done to improve the situation before Harvey. Hurricane Harvey brought 30 inches of water into his home. he said. Any fixes could take years, and are quite likely to require coordinating efforts among communities and the state of Texas. Until then, homeowners stew, fret and wait for the next big storm. Raul Giorgi, a real estate agent in The Woodlands for 35 years, owns a home near the Soeders that also was damaged. They look to real estate agents like him, he said, for information about risks, and he looks to the developers. John Schwartz and James Glanz reported from The Woodlands, and Andrew W.

The forecast calls for a 38 percent chance of at least one major hurricane making landfall along the Gulf Coast. While the rainfall may be in decline, the floodwaters are only beginning to recede. Arkema Inc. said the Harris County Emergency Operations Center notified the company at 2 a.m. of two explosions and black smoke coming from its Crosby plant, which was inundated by floodwater. This could lead to extreme floods, which could be life-threatening when coupled with the heavy rainfall Harvey has already brought to the region. Officials say they have to wait until the floodwaters recede before assessing the extent of the damage to their water pump; they have no idea how long that will take. According to officials, water from the Neches River was spilling into Steinhagen Lake faster than they could release it. Tyler County gave its constituents north of Beaumont a strong message: Evacuate immediately or die. The post warned that residents living in Mt.

Teachers Volunteering in Shelters is a newly formed group of Houston-area teachers who are organizing to help children in the flood-ravaged areas of Southeast Texas brought on by Hurricane Harvey. The group has already dispatched teachers to the George R. Brown Convention Center, NRG Center and Church of the Apostles Houston. Simone Kern, Director of Literacy Interventions at YES Prep Public Schools, started the group on Facebook. Kern, who is currently recovering from surgery and cannot volunteer in the shelters herself decided to put her administrative skills to work by organizing teachers and connecting them with shelters in need. Kristen McClintock, a member of the group and a special education teacher at West Side High School in Houston I.S.D, felt the need to do something to help children after Hurricane Harvey devastated the Houston area. As a special education teacher, McClintock was especially aware of the needs of children with autism, learning disabilities or other special needs. The group would like to coordinate with other area shelters and relief efforts to ensure that its teachers can provide their childcare and educational services in an effective, safe way to as many children as possible.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner. Recovery Czar Marvin Odum. Avoiding failure Turner said the city cannot be restored to how it was before Harvey hit because homes and businesses have been flooded out too many times in the past. The city needs to be more resilient for future storms, the mayor said.

Turner wants Harvey to be the example to transform and prepare the city going forward. The Addicks Reservoir in Houston on Aug. 29, 2017. He said the last one is key because there is more need than money available. Turner says development with impervious surfaces, without surrounding green space, leaves no place for the water to go. On top of that, there are about nine bayous that traverse the city of Houston, Turner said. This month, the Houston City Council is expected to consider a building ordinance to mitigate the risk of flooding in the future, Turner said.  The experts will discuss how to handle, dry, and clean these items. They will also discuss personal safety during the salvage process. That consensus appears to be crumbling.

The family has been staying in the hotel since late September with the help of FEMA. It likely will be well into the new year before many of these families find alternatives - and they, in many respects, are the lucky ones. Tens of thousands more have cobbled together their own temporary arrangements, living with relatives, in tents or on mattresses in barely habitable homes. In Houston, where local officials estimate the hurricane damaged more than 311,000 housing units - roughly a third of the housing stock - no one has moved into a trailer, secured an apartment or seen repair work begin through the state's interim housing programs. More permanent solutions could be years away. Hurricane Harvey scattered families to more than 1,500 hotels across the country Nearly 70,000 people displaced by the hurricane were staying in hotels paid for by FEMA as of Nov. 11, the most recent date for which detailed data was available. That figure has since dropped to more than 47,000, with most people staying in the Houston area. These delays leave Carl Williams, who has been living in a FEMA-funded room at a Marriott near Greenspoint Mall, with limited options. Now, struggling to find another place to rent or buy, the retired UPS worker feels like he's letting down his wife and adult son. Williams' 1-year-old grandson played with a leaf on the sidewalk as the pair waited in front of the hotel for Williams' wife to get back from work.

Stephanie Hernandez's 3-year-old daughter climbed on furniture in the lobby. Life wasn't bad here, in one of Houston's hotels with the highest population of FEMA residents, all things considered. Hernandez's children could watch Cartoon Network, there were two swimming pools, and housekeeping came every day. Still, it wasn't home. Living in hotels and motels for extended periods is not just hard on families; it's costly for taxpayers. It's taking too long to move displaced families into more permanent arrangements, and there's blame to share, said Tom McCasland, housing director for the city of Houston. Housing recovery after a natural disaster typically unfolds in three stages. In the first stage, FEMA helps families find safe, dry places to sleep. At the same time, the agency works with state officials to develop programs to get families into apartments, trailers or partially repaired homes. That's the second stage. It's supposed to hold families over until their homes are fully repaired with funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. That doesn't include the cost of the hotel program, which is slated to run through mid-January but has been extended several times - and probably will be again. FEMA's longer-term programs have been slow to reach residents. MORE: FEMA extends deadline for Harvey registration Although more than 9,500 Texas families had qualified for some form of additional temporary housing assistance as of Tuesday, just one had been able to move back into a home repaired through FEMA's program, and 223 were living in a trailer or mobile home. The state has not identified a single multifamily property owner willing to participate in its rental programs. Houston officials, meanwhile, have yet to approve an agreement with the state's General Land Office to manage the local rollout of FEMA's interim housing programs, and flood victims here likely will not start benefitting from federally funded apartments, trailers or repairs for several more weeks at the earliest. None of this is new. Federal efforts to rebuild housing after natural disasters are notoriously sluggish. With that in mind, Zack Rosenburg, CEO of a New Orleans-based disaster recovery organization, the St. Bernard Project, gave local and state officials high marks. MORE: Harvey's hotel bump will be short-lived, expert says Shannon Van Zandt, a fellow at Texas A&M's Hazard Reduction and Recovery Center, praised FEMA's and the state's emergency response but was more critical of their housing efforts. Heather Lagrone, deputy director for the land office's community development and revitalization program said the state is doing everything it can to get programs up and running. FEMA spokesman Robert Howard pointed to bureaucratic challenges. Even once FEMA's housing programs launch in Houston, it does not appear they will come close to meeting the city's full temporary housing needs. Bolstered by philanthropic giving in Harvey's wake, nonprofits have stepped in to help fill the void, or at least a small part of it. Rebuilding Together had begun work on 25 homes as of mid-November, and Holland hopes to complete a total of 250 next year. Avenue CDC, which primarily builds new affordable housing, has ventured into disaster recovery as well and plans to make basic repairs to 145 homes over the next four months. Nonprofit executives acknowledged their efforts will leave many families in need. She joined the Chronicle in 2014 as a crime and general assignment reporter in Fort Bend County.

Cedar Bayou, 30 miles to the east of downtown, got 51.88 inches, a record rainfall event for the continental U.S. Far eastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana were also hit by this storm as it made a second landfall on Aug. 30. The devastating storm caused extensive damage and more than 80 deaths. All branches of the U.S. military were called in to help. Catastrophic flooding put much of Houston under water.

A fast and efficient response would have shown critics the organization has learned from its past mistakes and is a capable partner when disaster strikes. Weeks after the storm, state and local officials, including Gov. Greg Abbott, complain of a charity disorganized and slow-to-respond. One Texas lawmaker who represents a section of rain-pummeled Houston, where thousands of people lost their homes and belongings to Harvey's floods, said he's had enough with the missteps and confusion. Then, a Congressional inquiry found the organization was using about a quarter of the money directed to the 2010 Haiti earthquake for other expenses. It also faces dwindling revenues, a smaller workforce and fewer volunteers than it did just a few years ago. While some local officials were pleased with the Red Cross response, others argue more could have been done on the ground. Consider Port Aransas Mayor Charles Bujan part of the latter group. Some applications were thought to be mistakenly rejected due to technological issues. Gov. Greg Abbott looks over damaged stores in Rockport, TX, during a tour on Monday, August 28, 2017, two days after Hurricane Harvey hit the town.

It would also require that jail administrators honor all requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to hold an inmate for possible deportation. The law has stoked fears within the immigrant community with some fearing they could be asked for their status when they come into any contact with law enforcement. But Republicans who back the bill have pushed back and said the law only targets immigrants who have committed serious crimes. Shannon Edmunds, the director of governmental relations for the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, said even if SB 4 goes into effect during the rescue operations, undocumented immigrants should not fear law enforcement. But he also conceded that immigrant communities also have their own interpretation of what the law could mean.

Mexico City, Parched and Sinking, Faces a Water Crisis Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor. Water drains naturally in this stretch of Texas, or at least it used to. At more than 600 square miles, Houston has grown to be as big as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia combined, a giant spread of asphalt smothering many of the floodplains that once shuttled water from the prairies to the sea. When finished, the newest road to ring the city and propel its expansion, called the Grand Parkway, will encircle an area equivalent to all of Rhode Island. For years, the local authorities turned a blind eye to runaway development. Thousands of homes have been built next to, and even inside, the boundaries of the two big reservoirs devised by the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1940s after devastating floods. Back then, Houston was 20 miles downstream, its population 400,000. Today, these reservoirs are smack in the middle of an urban agglomeration of six million. We have bridged the continent with railways and roads, erected cities in the desert, and changed the course of rivers. Built on a mosquito-infested Texas swamp, Houston similarly willed itself into a great city. Its sprawl of highways and single-family homes is a postwar version of the American dream. Unfortunately, nature always gets the last word. The very forces that pushed the city forward are threatening its way of life. Sprawl is only part of the story. Houston is also built on an upbeat, pro-business strategy of low taxes and little government. Many Texans regard this as the key to prosperity, an antidote to Washington. It encapsulates a potent vision of an unfettered America. Harvey called that concept into question. It may have been an unusually bad hurricane, dumping trillions of gallons of water in a few days, even more to the east of the city than to the west, in the prairie, and setting all kinds of records. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Cypress Creek Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Buffalo Bayou Barker Reservoir Buildings Damaged by Hurricane Harvey Brays Bayou Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Buildings Damaged By Hurricane Harvey Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Barker Reservoir Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. 100-year floodplain Properties with flood damage in Hurricane Harvey Cypress Creek Addicks Reservoir HOUSTON Barker Reservoir Buffalo Bayou Brays Bayou Buildings Damaged By Hurricane Harvey Thousands of buildings in Houston were damaged both inside and outside the official floodplain. Global warming may not specifically have caused Harvey, any more than a single major league home run can be attributed to steroids. That said, scientists have little doubt that climate change is making storms worse and more frequent. Coming right after those events, Harvey has led even some pro-development enthusiasts to rethink the city and its surroundings.

Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor. A self-described traditional Republican and big backer of the Grand Parkway, Judge Emmett had planned on spending his twilight years in public service saving the Houston Astrodome from demolition. Harvey altered that. Now he thinks his mission is to protect the entire region. After every natural calamity, American politicians make big promises. They say: We will rebuild. We will not be defeated. Never again will we be caught unprepared. But they rarely tackle the toughest obstacles. Resettling neighborhoods, making certain places off-limits to development, creating dikes and reservoirs is difficult, both financially and politically. It takes longer than most election cycles. Memories fade. Inertia sets in. Residents just want to get their lives back to normal. Politicians want votes, not trouble. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans, for better and worse, used its cataclysm as an opportunity to reboot, not just fixing levees but overhauling public schools, hospitals and many neighborhoods. It was a wrenching process. The mere suggestion of moving people out of vulnerable neighborhoods set off bitter protests, causing the city to back down from some of its most sweeping proposals. Texas after Harvey is no different, and perhaps even less prepared to change. Like the rest of America, it is deeply divided between urban and rural, Democrat and Republican. Houston is a blue city with a black mayor in a bright red state. Ultimately, though, any resolution will require that everyone face the same threats together. The spread of asphalt and concrete has inhibited rainwater from draining naturally in Houston. When finished, the Grand Parkway, above, on the edge of Houston, will encircle an area equivalent to all of Rhode Island. He remembers escaping years ago to the prairie to bird watch. One recent morning he drove me out there along the Grand Parkway and pulled into an unfinished subdivision. The development, she said, adheres to county standards requiring that houses be raised above the 100-year floodplain. The woman handed Mr. Blackburn a glossy brochure and a disclaimer, which he scanned before climbing back into the car, shaking his head. The disclaimer explained that roads outside the development, linking it to the parkway, occupy the 10-year floodplain, meaning they would have about a 10 percent chance of flooding every year. But that requires politicians to agree. An upbeat narrative casts business-friendly Texas in the loner role of swashbuckling cowboy, disdainful of coastal elites. He believes cities are the culprit. For years, Texas Republicans promoted local controls to push against federal court orders on issues like desegregation and same-sex marriage. Now state leaders have made a U-turn. Little wonder, post-Harvey, that state and local officials have anointed different flood and recovery czars. Texas is sounding these days like Russia under the Romanovs. The system ensures nobody is clearly in charge. Least of all in Houston. Two other bills to study flooding in the Houston region, introduced in the last legislative session, died in committee. I met with the mayor in City Hall at the time. He noted that the Legislature had convened a special session to ban gender-neutral bathrooms. Another official, this one with the county, made the point that the area around Houston is a patchwork of counties and municipalities with different rules and no coordination because Texans believed the upside of what became, in essence, institutionalized entropy was that it allowed residents to avoid the encumbrances of city governments, regulations and taxes. The problem is that hurricanes and floods, worsened by climate change, do not recognize political borders or county lines. Their toll is shared by everyone. The hypocrisy of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, resisting federal aid to the New York region after Hurricane Sandy but then requesting it for Texas after Harvey, is in fact part of this same history. Bruce Hooper, outside his home in Kashmere Gardens in Houston, would like to move but has no place to go. Before it elected Mr. Turner, it elected a mayor who was a lesbian. The city is in thrall to cars and highways and has precious little mass transit, but the municipality of Houston relies more on renewable energy than any other big city in America. Houston has more green space, relative to paved, than New York. They insist that its business-friendly, light-on-regulations approach helps account for a big rise in employment since 2000. Decades later, Houston boasts of becoming the most diverse big city in the country, with comparatively low housing costs that translate to higher levels of minority homeownership. Harris County officials say they have received as many requests for buyouts since the hurricane (3,000) as there have been buyouts since the mid-1990s. Harvey turned out to be an equal opportunity disaster. They are among the homeowners hoping for a buyout. Buying out rich homes to repurpose vulnerable areas like Meyerland for flood detention, as Mr. Sacks notes, would require loads of money and remove valuable properties from tax rolls in a county that relies on property taxes. Bruce Hooper would move, too. During Harvey, he woke up to crackling sounds, when floodwaters started to seep into his appliances and electrical outlets. Mr. Hooper lives in a poor area called Kashmere Gardens. I found him sitting on a tattered lawn chair outside the shell of his tumbledown rental. An unemployed former parks employee, Mr. Hooper told me that he and his family of five had to be airlifted out by the Coast Guard after a detention pond overflowed and water inside the house rose from ankle to chest high in an hour. The Kahans own a single-story home in a middle-class neighborhood, Bear Creek Village. Christine Kahan and her husband had lived for 28 years in their house without a flood. Now Ms. Kahan said she would entertain a buyout. A part-time real-estate agent, she advises clients to think twice about buying any home that flooded. Hers is now one of them. But Mr. Kahan says they will stay, for the time being. I asked how that lined up with his desire not to leave Bear Creek. One afternoon I biked with Guy Hagstette around Buffalo Bayou Park. The Allen brothers were real estate swindlers from New York who founded Houston in 1836. After oil turned up beneath the muck and clay, they seemed like prophets. It collapsed riverbanks and left dunes of silt that buried pedestrian paths, playgrounds and fields. He meant not just repairing and fortifying the park, but also adapting Houston to the new normal. For starters, that will require fresh numbers. Harris County demands that new developments retain enough rainwater on site to neutralize the effects of a 100-year storm. But those 100-year numbers date back years. They are based on mitigating a storm that averages 13.2 inches of rain in 24 hours. Harvey brought 25.9 inches in 24 hours. The Memorial Day flood dropped 11 inches in three hours. The Tax Day flood dumped 17 inches in 12 hours in the Katy Prairie. As meteorologist for the Harris County Flood Control District, Mr. Lindner spent five sleepless days and nights during Harvey as an unshakable, tousled expert in a blue, button-down shirt, going on television and providing Houstonians with useful information. We met at the flood control district office one morning. Mr. Blackburn tells a story about a local hero, Jesse Jones, the former secretary of commerce, who helped secure federal funds for the ship channel. In 1929, Mr. Jones convinced fellow Houston bankers to put aside reserves of cash that prevented city banks from failing in the Depression. What may save Houston today, Mr. Blackburn said, is another common-sense strategy involving stricter controls and infrastructural investments that somehow lets state Republicans acquiesce behind closed doors but beat their chests in public. A hurricane that pushes a massive storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico into Galveston Bay, up the ship channel, could overwhelm refineries and unleash a toxic tsunami, killing many and rattling the national economy. The judge and mayor are among those talking about a so-called Ike Dike, named after Hurricane Ike in 2008, which killed dozens in Texas. It would be a massive sea-gate that could block a surge.

For those who moved, the decision was only made easier when real estate investors came to them with an opportunity. They had cash right then and right there. If you wanted to move, there was no need to wait on a buyout. It was a deal people thought was too good not to take. Hunn reported investors have bought up 5,500 homes in Harvey-affected neighborhoods, turning many of them into rentals. The Bear Creek water tower on August 27, 2017, during Hurricane Harvey. New rentals in these neighborhoods are filling a hole in the post-disaster housing market, according to Texas A&M urban planning professor Shannon Van Zandt. She got broken into like twice in a week in her old place. But even as these rentals have provided an opportunity for a lot of people, they have created tension within the community. Minto said some homeowners worry that new renters will disrupt the sense of community in Bear Creek, and others worry that renters do not have as big a financial stake in the neighborhood. In August, Harris County will vote on two-point-five billion dollars worth of bonds to fund flood control projects.

A year later, she and her family continue to help Rockport rebuild, while the port continues to fine-tune its emergency preparedness plans. Danielle Hale had been working 18-hour shifts for a few days already when her son Conner, then 7, called. Days earlier, Hurricane Harvey made landfall on Aug. 25, shaking the coastal communities of Rockport and Port Aransas before traveling further up the Gulf Coast to stay put over Houston. A year later, Hale and her family continue to help rebuild Rockport, where residents are still repairing damaged homes and City Hall remains closed. She is the seventh to receive the award since it was created in 2002, and the first for actions related to a hurricane. With the help of family and friends, the Hales have been able to transition from being displaced to living in an RV to finally moving into a new home. After Harvey, she stayed at the port until Aug. 31 before regrouping with her family. But Hale chose to stay. It was her job, but it was also an outlet to keep her mind busy. After watching her mother work as an EMT, and surviving the Aggie bonfire collapse of 1999, she felt instilled with a desire to help. So, she took a job as a 911 dispatcher. From there, she expanded her skills to work as an EMT, volunteer firefighter and paramedic. She started teaching courses at regional fire safety schools. Interested in how to make the emergency response system better, she made the jump from providing one-on-one treatment to emergency management. After about 15 years of working throughout the Coastal Bend, she started at the port in October 2016. The Port of Corpus Christi is a key shipping access point on the Gulf, handling commodities like petroleum and grain. It is the fourth largest port by tonnage in the country. They activated the emergency operations center before Harvey made landfall. Hale had handled hurricane response before, managing emergency operations during Katrina and Ike. But Harvey was her first Category 4 storm. With no hurricanes hitting Corpus Christi since the 1970s, all they had to rely on was past planning and training. For days, Hale coordinated between different port departments and first responders. After six days, the port was able to re-open with no casualties or environmental incidents. As operations at the shipping hub returned to normal, it was time to assess the damage to the community. For Hale, that not only meant figuring things out for her family, but for friends in the area as well. Hale was named a StormReady Community Hero by the National Weather Service. Hale knew of generations of families in her community who had lost their homes at once. Hale was surprised to see these details mentioned in the nomination for her StormReady Hero award. Rather, her award is a chance to remind people to gear up for hurricane season and reflect on the progress her community has made. Keep us in your thoughts.

CreditIlana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times For all of the uncertainties that await Houston and coastal Texas, we can be reasonably sure about one thing: Many of those flooded out by Hurricane Harvey will watch their investments and savings collapse into debt and bankruptcy. And the heaviest burdens, of course, will fall on the shoulders of low- and middle-income residents. If past disasters are any indication, those numbers will only grow in the coming days and weeks. Whatever the ultimate figure, the losses will represent, in part, the aggregation of hundreds of thousands or more individual financial calamities. Even for the lucky 15 percent of homeowners in Houston and surrounding Harris County, who have a federal flood policy in place, collecting claims will most likely be a protracted and contentious process. Those homeowners will be forced to fall back on some combination of disaster relief, loans and savings. Although homeowners with government-backed mortgages will be able to hold off on payments for at least 90 days, eventually they will have to honor mortgages on houses that are uninhabitable or even swept away. Renters may never return home. In short, many Texans will be starting over economically. Roosevelt likened the Great Depression to the devastation of the Dust Bowl, tornadoes in Georgia, and floods on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers to build his case for the huge public investments and assistance programs that transformed the fates of Americans who were also starting over. In the last several decades of American policy making, however, we have seen those protections and provisions eroded, along with divestments in the kinds of public goods like knowledge and infrastructure that help us to live safe and secure lives, in good times and bad. The outpouring of solidarity and support we have seen from ordinary people during Hurricane Harvey is not matched by programs that institutionalize a commitment to collective flourishing. This has been for many Americans its own kind of slow-motion disaster. A recent report by American scientists concluded that the effects of climate change are already with us. Congress and state legislatures disburse emergency funds, which are then offset in budgets with cuts to social services and public spending. Recovery from previous disasters, like Hurricane Katrina, has had regressive effects, heightening the disparities between rich and poor and perpetuating systemic racism. But this historic storm, like the Great Depression, should also motivate a reconsideration of our broader social contract: a new New Deal. We should invest in science and public education to train the next generation of engineers who will build safer homes and infrastructure. We should expand and enhance programs that make adaptation to climate change possible for ordinary Americans, helping them to retrofit their homes or relocate to safer ground. We should plan recovery and rebuilding projects that address local poverty and exclusion, rather than line the pockets of developers. We should commit expenditures to the kinds of projects that mitigate climate change, like clean energy and public transportation. How we respond to Hurricane Harvey and the floods to come will demonstrate who and what we value. A new New Deal commits us to caring for one another after the disaster has passed.

After Hurricane Harvey pushed oily floodwaters into their house in August, the Loshaks asked local officials to buy them out, joining more than 3,000 other Houston-area homeowners who grew weary of ripping out waterlogged drywall and ruined refrigerators after three devastating floods in three years. The buyout program is just one way Houston hopes to better protect itself against future floods. But even as the city prepares to demolish thousands of homes in low-lying areas, developers are putting up hundreds more. As Houston rebuilds from the most expensive hurricane in U.S. history, local officials plan to dredge waterways, build new reservoirs and a coastal barrier to protect against storms that experts say are growing in intensity due to a warming climate. Some local leaders, such as Harris County Judge Ed Emmett, have called for development rules to be tightened and for new taxes to fund flood defenses.

Mr. Pelletiere is one of the many speculators driving a new economy in the area, buying and selling flooded homes. Nick Pelletiere at his home in Canyon Gate, which is undergoing repairs after it was damaged by flooding during Hurricane Harvey. Canyon Gate was still in ruins, its streets strewn with moldy furniture, the stench of rot everywhere. But somehow, someone had managed to plant dozens, maybe hundreds of them across the tiny Houston suburb. Bernadette Leaney, 67, one of the thousands of Houston residents whose homes were swamped in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, hated them. She and her neighbors were just beginning their grim reckoning with the damage. She tried to ignore the come-ons. His name was Nick Pelletiere, she learned. He ran a company that transported cadavers for funeral homes, but recently he had expanded into another lightly regulated trade: buying and selling flooded homes. People in Canyon Gate called him Shady Nick. Many parts of the city were hit hard by the hurricane, but Canyon Gate has the extraordinary distinction of being built within the confines of a reservoir specifically designed by the Army Corps of Engineers to protect central Houston from calamitous flooding. Nearly every one of the 721 homes there is destined to flood again, yet the local trade in storm-damaged real estate is flourishing. But where some saw calamity, Mr. Pelletiere, a 47-year-old Chicagoan who followed his star to Houston two years ago, saw opportunity. And buy he did. Within weeks, Mr. Pelletiere snapped up seven properties in areas hit by Harvey, all at a steep discount from their pre-storm values, pocketing sizable gains while some of his neighbors were grappling with financial ruin. Mr. Pelletiere laughed when he learned that his neighbors had taken to calling him Shady Nick. He said that the months since the storm had tested everyone. A few days later, he underwent surgery to have a pacemaker implanted in his chest to help treat heart failure. Neither the shady nickname nor the abnormal heart rate seemed to faze him. Those who are alive need to buy or sell their homes. Image Signs for services related to flood damage appeared around the neighborhood not long after Harvey swept through, destroying homes and forcing residents to throw away mud-covered belongings. The city was founded in 1836 by two brothers from New York, John and Augustus Allen, who had immigrated to what was then northeast Mexico only to side with the pro-slavery separatists who led the Texas Revolution. But Houston, which is projected in about a decade to edge past Chicago as the third-largest city in the United States, has endured its own share of weather misfortune. The reservoir in which Canyon Gate persists owes its existence to yet another calamity, the Great Houston Flood of 1935. Rains that year turned the streets of downtown Houston into choppy rivers, killing several people and shutting down the Port of Houston for eight months. Authorities built flood-control reservoirs in the 1940s, in effect creating new flood zones to protect the old ones. Canyon Gate is designed to flood, but it is not part of the 100-year floodplain defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, so it is not covered by FEMA rules that require mortgage seekers in flood zones to buy flood insurance. Some residents say little effort has been made to inform buyers of the risks they face. How One Houston Suburb Ended Up in a Reservoir Most residents whose homes flooded during Hurricane Harvey had no clue that their gated community was built in an area prone to such damage in extreme storms. March 22, 2018 In the beginning, it seemed like there was no need. County officials insisted that the developer warn prospective buyers that the homes lay in a flood reservoir, and Land Tejas agreed to do so, but only by way of an obscure filing. And yet the neighborhood is attractive in many ways. Canyon Gate, as its name suggests, offers a coveted sense of safety. It is also a remarkably cheap place to buy a home, and getting even cheaper. Before the storm and after, Canyon Gate stood out for its capacity for welcoming people from around the world, its cul-de-sacs home to Nigerians, Indians, Venezuelans and Canadians, along with people from dozens of other countries. Fort Bend County ranks among the most ethnically diverse places in the world. Metropolitan Houston already has a population of 6.6 million and it is projected to reach 14.2 million by 2050, according to the Texas Demographic Center. Video After Hurricane Harvey hit, these communities, built in what is called a flood pool, were sacrificed to save the city of Houston. We followed homeowners as they decided whether to cut their losses or rebuild, knowing it could happen again. The Disaster Economy Mr. Pelletiere, for his part, sees nothing wrong with buying flooded homes. He said he did not expect everyone to approve of what he was doing, but said that investing in such real estate depended on acquiring local knowledge and accurately measuring the value of a property. Even now, he said he refrained from informing buyers of his damaged homes of the flood risks, explaining that the law did not require him to do so. He was darting around his home, barking instructions to construction workers fixing the first floor. He dropped out of community college, he said, after realizing that higher education was not for him. Seeking opportunity, he lit out west for Southern California, where he met his wife, who works in the aviation software industry. Undaunted by his lack of a college degree, Mr. Pelletiere worked in corporate sales jobs, founded his cadaver-transport venture, and dabbled in real estate in San Diego, embracing the chance to use those skills when his wife was transferred to Houston. Image Mr. Pelletiere inspected a property for the first time that he purchased sight unseen in Canyon Gate. After the storm in August, Mr. Pelletiere joined a constellation of other speculators scrambling to buy flooded homes on the cheap. Canyon Gate scored well on nearly every measure, and Big State bought 13 homes in the neighborhood in the months after the hurricane. Mr. Spitz, a fourth-generation Texan with family roots in the pest control business, plunged into the post-disaster frenzy, snapping up 150 homes around Houston in the first 90 days after the storm. He said that some of the most alluring opportunities were found in areas with relatively low-priced properties before the storm, since homeowners in those neighborhoods sometimes lacked the financial resources to quickly rebuild.

A Canadian immigrant from British Columbia, she moved to Houston 13 years ago after living in Britain, Indonesia and France, countries where her husband worked for an oil services company. She said she was drawn to the community by its affordability and its access to open spaces. Research by climate scientists suggests that speculators of flooded homes will only see their market expand. The Environmental Protection Agency also acknowledges that flooding is growing much more frequent along the United States coastline, especially in Mid-Atlantic States where subsiding land and increases in relative sea level contribute to making floods 10 times more common in some areas than in the 1950s. Image James Smith, right, a real estate agent who deals in flooded homes. He acknowledged he is often the recipient of considerable negative energy from residents. One study showed that the seven-day rainfall from Harvey increased by at least 19 percent, and perhaps by as much as 38 percent, compared with similar storms in the mid-20th century, when the reservoirs designed to save the rest of Houston were built. Antonia Sebastian, a flood engineer at Rice University on the team of researchers that described how climate change made Hurricane Harvey more destructive, said she was as stunned as anyone to discover where Canyon Gate was built. For the speculators, the cycle of destruction presents a simpler proposition. James Smith, a fast-talking, cowboy-boot clad veteran of the Marines, moved to Houston from Florida after the 2008 housing crash. As a real estate agent who deals in flooded homes, he acknowledged he is often the recipient of considerable negative energy. Some of the residents in Canyon Gate questioning why he would do such work showed him the middle finger when he pulled up in his Mercedes S.U.V.

The practice creates a perception of safety from flooding that might not be justified, said Houston attorney Jim Blackburn. Harris County requires developers to offset fill by creating an equivalent amount of water storage. A post-Harvey analysis by Hickey and other residents found most of the flooded homes from Harvey were built on land raised using fill. Since 2015, the Houston area has experienced three 500-year floods, events with a 0.2 percent chance of occurring any given year. Nearly three-quarters of the 204,000 Harris County homes and apartments damaged during Harvey were outside the 100-year flood plain, according to an analysis by the newspaper. The issue is part of a broader debate about responsible development after Harvey. Last week, the Houston City Council narrowly approved stricter development rules proposed by Mayor Sylvester Turner. Meanwhile, 80 percent of hurricane victims did not have flood insurance, and for many, help is not coming fast enough.

Reporters Discuss Houston Matters talks with three local journalists about the intricacies and challenges of covering disasters like Harvey. As Hurricane Harvey made its path towards the Texas coast, news media outlets geared up for the long haul of heavy coverage before, during, and well after the storm. Our colleagues here at Houston Public Media worked here on campus, in the field, and even from their own homes, as the floodwaters rose, aiming to keep listeners informed about the situation. The Houston SPCA just announced it has reunited more than 200 animals with their owners in the aftermath of Harvey. We talk with the Lisa Tynan, Community Outreach Manager for the Houston SPCA about their efforts, especially when it comes to the bigger animals. She, like others, has lost everything, and needs to find a place to stay once she and her family leave the George R. Brown Convention Center. Read the report below. Some of the recommendations include building a culture of awareness around flooding risks, trusting the public with information about potential dangers and making flood insurance more universally appealing to home and business owners. The report said that a lack of a coordinated regulatory environment to deal with development and adequately warn residents of potential flooding dangers exacerbated flood damages. The report says there were numerous steps that could have been taken in the years before Harvey that would have softened the impact of flooding from the reservoirs, including not allowing homes to be built in them and their surrounding floodways and giving adequate disclosures about flooding risks whenever homes around the reservoirs were sold. Solutions should be broader than widening bayous and building more reservoirs but also have to include leaving more open spaces, restoring wetlands and robust regulations, according to the report. Texas relies on tax receipts from property-rich school districts to help pay for poorer ones, a system known as recapture.

Hurricane Harvey formed in the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall in southeastern Texas, bringing record flooding and destruction to the region. He emphasizes that all money donated will be put to good use. Distribution of the money is being handled by the Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund set up by Turner and Harris County Judge Ed Emmett. A ten-member board, co-chaired by Harris County Budget Officer Bill Jackson, and Chase Source Chairman and CEO Anthony Chase, is charged with dispersing funds. Turner said the board is primarily made up of people that have donated to the fund and the money will get to those in need quickly. With the core values of Share, Trust, United, and Family, the organization focuses on the areas of Disaster Relief, Culture and Education, Public Health, and Environmental Protection. Golden Bank Chairman, and Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce of North America President Kenneth Wu said the donation provides an opportunity to show concern. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. One thing that's giving Turner and others hope is that billions of federal dollars have been allocated to pay for flood-mitigation projects. Houston, which was founded on the banks of the Buffalo Bayou in 1836 and rises barely above sea level, has long been susceptible to flooding. But recent growth has made the problem worse. The area has more pavement, which generates more stormwater runoff, and has lost wetlands that could soak up that runoff. And they want to undertake a project known as the coastal spine, which was first proposed after Hurricane Ike in 2008. Whichever projects are ultimately funded, they will probably take years to build. Harris County Judge Ed Emmett, the top elected official in the county where Houston is located, said he wasn't reassured by promises from state officials. He also noted that they had pushed to cut property taxes, which Harris County uses to pay for its flood-control efforts. That will be on the ballot sometime this year. Texas A&M University at Galveston marine sciences professor Sam Brody cautioned that Houston and the rest of Texas can't engineer their way out of flooding issues by only relying on large-scale projects. Efforts such as buying out homes in flood-prone areas and being mindful of future development must play a role in making the area more flood resilient, he said. The City Council is set to vote in the coming week on stricter rules. Harris County approved new restrictions late last year. Both Houston and Harris County are also pursuing a home buyout strategy.

And we discuss the latest on developments in Houston sports. But it also is the largest U.S. city to have no zoning laws, part of a hands-off approach to urban planning that may have contributed to catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Harvey and left thousands of residents in harm's way. Growth that is virtually unchecked, including in flood-prone areas, has diminished the land's already-limited natural ability to absorb water, according to environmentalists and experts in land use and natural disasters. And the city's drainage system - a network of reservoirs, bayous and, as a last resort, roads that hold and drain water - was not designed to handle the massive storms that are increasingly common. Certainly, the record-shattering rainfall on Houston and its surrounding area this week would have wreaked havoc even if stricter building limits and better runoff systems were in place. And local officials have defended the city's approach to development. But the unfolding disaster - at least 22 people are dead and 30 percent of Harris County, which includes Houston, is underwater - is drawing renewed scrutiny to Houston's approach to city planning and its unique system for managing floodwater. Over many years, officials in Houston and Harris County have resisted calls for more stringent building codes. Proposals for large-scale flood-control projects envisioned in the wake of Hurricane Ike in 2008 stalled. City residents have voted three times not to enact a zoning code, most recently in 1993. Rather than impose restrictions on what property owners can do with their land, Houston has attempted to engineer a solution to drainage. The region depends on a network of bayous - slow-moving streams that run east into Galveston Bay - and concrete channels as the main drainage system. Streets and detention ponds are designed to carry and hold the overflow. The biggest rainstorm in the history of the continental United States finally began to move away from Houston on Tuesday, as the remnants of Hurricane Harvey and its endless, merciless rain bands spun east to menace Louisiana instead. But, after more than 50 inches of rain over four days, Houston... In previous public comments, the leaders of the Harris County Flood Control District have rejected the idea that the city's growth is responsible for massive flooding. They also have disputed the scientific assessments. Those officials were not available this week. And in hindsight, it's real easy to say that. But the rules and regulations were what they needed to be at the time. They say that new homes should be elevated and that construction should be prohibited in some flood-prone areas. Houston's system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain a tabletop-flat city prone to heavy rains. But its Depression-era design is no match for the stresses brought by explosive development and ever-wetter storms. Nearly any city would be overwhelmed by the more than 4 feet of rain that Hurricane... At least 4,000 residential and commercial properties in Harris County have been built since 2010 in the official flood plain the federal government designated as the 100-year flood plain, according to a Washington Post review of areas at the greatest risk of flooding. Some other cities also allow building in flood plains, with varying degrees of regulation. At the same time, severe storms are becoming more frequent, experts said. The city's building laws are designed to guard against what was once considered a worst-case scenario - a 100-year storm, or one that planners projected would have only a 1 percent chance of happening in any given year. Those storms have become quite common, however. Harvey, which dumped up to 50 inches of rain in some places as of Tuesday afternoon, is the third such storm to hit Houston in the past three years. In May 2015, seven people died after 12 inches of rain fell in 10 hours during what is known as the Memorial Day Flood. Eight people died in April 2016 during a storm that dropped 17 inches of rain. Like other coastal areas, Houston and its surrounding areas have repeatedly turned to federal taxpayers for help rebuilding. It ranks third in the amount paid by the National Flood Insurance Program, behind Orleans and Jefferson parishes in Louisiana, which sustained significant damage during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In the 1940s, the Army Corps of Engineers built two massive reservoirs that serve as holding areas during big downpours. In the following decades, the city carved out additional concrete channels and lined bayous with pavement to shunt water away. Houston's population climbed to 2.2 million in 2015, a 25 percent increase from 1995. Harris County had an even bigger bump over that time, 42 percent, and now has 4.4 million residents. As the population grew, the city expanded, covering fallow land that had served as a natural sponge. Between 1992 and 2010, 30 percent of the surrounding county's coastal prairie wetlands were paved over, according to a 2010 report from Texas A&M. Projects to widen the bayous and build thousands of retention ponds for excess water have not kept pace with the new rooftops, roadways and parking lots needed to accommodate about 150,000 new residents a year, experts say. As a backup, roads were built below grade and designed to take on excess water when storm drains overflow. When the streets fill up, though, evacuation becomes more difficult. In the days before Harvey struck, city officials urged residents to stay put. On social media, local officials knocked down predictions that as many as 50 inches of rain were expected - reports that overstated the forecast at the time but turned out to align more closely with the eventual rainfall. When the rain came, roads turned into waterways, requiring door-to-door boat rescues. In many areas of the city, especially the older parts, water that breaches the roadways flows into homes that sit on ground-level slabs. John Jacob, director of the Texas Coastal Watershed Program and a professor at Texas A&M, said he was particularly incensed to hear about a nursing home in Dickinson, southeast of Houston, where residents in wheelchairs were sitting in waist-deep water. They were rescued after photos of them went viral on social media. That adds thousands of dollars to the cost and isn't required by city or county building codes. All of Harris County's 34 municipalities have their own plans for addressing flooding issues whose causes and solutions extend beyond borders. Last year, the state's high court dismissed a class-action lawsuit brought by 400 Harris County homeowners who suffered flood damage three times in five years - during Tropical Storm Frances in 1998, Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, and an unnamed storm in 2002. The county argued in court that it had spent tens of millions of dollars on flood control and disputed the homeowners' claim that developers had free rein. A majority of the court agreed, saying residents failed to directly link development in one part of the watershed with flooding in their particular homes. The Washington Post's Aaron C. Davis, Jack Gillum and Andrew Tran contributed to this report. Paul England pilots his boat through floodwaters in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Harvey in Port Arthur, Texas, on Sept. 2, 2017.

For several days after, Boufford and his family were trapped in their Humble home because of street flooding. It was the worst flooding the city has seen since Hurricane Harvey hit nearly a year ago. Only a handful of structures were flooded, said Brian Kyle, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The remaining 255 were the result of accidents throughout the day. Taking note of forecasts, he said, city police, fire, and public works departments notified employees ahead of the holiday that extra manpower could be needed. It was. Involved departments continuously monitored the floods, he said, with police and fire departments feeding information about emergency calls back to Flanagan and his staff. Added public awareness also helped keep damage to a minimum, Flanagan said. Had the flooding not occurred on a holiday, rush hour traffic could have made matters worse, Kyle said. Residents and business owners watched the rain cautiously. Alice Kimsong said she trusted the city to take proper precautions but was still scared. Kimsong is the manager of Padthai Thai Restaurant, located near Buffalo Bayou, a flood-prone body of water in the heart of the city. After Harvey, the restaurant went without power for one month and was out of business for six months due to repairs. Scattered rain continued throughout the area on Thursday, but Kyle said residents should expect anywhere from no rainfall to a half inch heading into the weekend. Flanagan said with such heavy rainfall on Wednesday, slowed rainfall later in the day was a blessing for the city.  That could include money to build a third reservoir for Houston. Hurricane Harvey could be adding a new sense of urgency for Congress to fund long-needed flood control projects. One of the projects getting some fresh attention involves building a third reservoir, to the northwest of Houston. That could come next, and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick is pushing Congress to help pay for projects to reduce the flood risk in Houston. We need more reservoirs. We need a coastal barrier.

Mr. Pelletiere is one of the many speculators driving a new economy in the area, buying and selling flooded homes. Nick Pelletiere at his home in Canyon Gate, which is undergoing repairs after it was damaged by flooding during Hurricane Harvey. Canyon Gate was still in ruins, its streets strewn with moldy furniture, the stench of rot everywhere. But somehow, someone had managed to plant dozens, maybe hundreds of them across the tiny Houston suburb. Bernadette Leaney, 67, one of the thousands of Houston residents whose homes were swamped in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, hated them. She and her neighbors were just beginning their grim reckoning with the damage. She tried to ignore the come-ons. His name was Nick Pelletiere, she learned. He ran a company that transported cadavers for funeral homes, but recently he had expanded into another lightly regulated trade: buying and selling flooded homes. People in Canyon Gate called him Shady Nick. Many parts of the city were hit hard by the hurricane, but Canyon Gate has the extraordinary distinction of being built within the confines of a reservoir specifically designed by the Army Corps of Engineers to protect central Houston from calamitous flooding. Nearly every one of the 721 homes there is destined to flood again, yet the local trade in storm-damaged real estate is flourishing. But where some saw calamity, Mr. Pelletiere, a 47-year-old Chicagoan who followed his star to Houston two years ago, saw opportunity. And buy he did. Within weeks, Mr. Pelletiere snapped up seven properties in areas hit by Harvey, all at a steep discount from their pre-storm values, pocketing sizable gains while some of his neighbors were grappling with financial ruin. Mr. Pelletiere laughed when he learned that his neighbors had taken to calling him Shady Nick. He said that the months since the storm had tested everyone. A few days later, he underwent surgery to have a pacemaker implanted in his chest to help treat heart failure. Neither the shady nickname nor the abnormal heart rate seemed to faze him. Those who are alive need to buy or sell their homes. Image Signs for services related to flood damage appeared around the neighborhood not long after Harvey swept through, destroying homes and forcing residents to throw away mud-covered belongings. The city was founded in 1836 by two brothers from New York, John and Augustus Allen, who had immigrated to what was then northeast Mexico only to side with the pro-slavery separatists who led the Texas Revolution. But Houston, which is projected in about a decade to edge past Chicago as the third-largest city in the United States, has endured its own share of weather misfortune. The reservoir in which Canyon Gate persists owes its existence to yet another calamity, the Great Houston Flood of 1935. Rains that year turned the streets of downtown Houston into choppy rivers, killing several people and shutting down the Port of Houston for eight months. Authorities built flood-control reservoirs in the 1940s, in effect creating new flood zones to protect the old ones. Canyon Gate is designed to flood, but it is not part of the 100-year floodplain defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, so it is not covered by FEMA rules that require mortgage seekers in flood zones to buy flood insurance. Some residents say little effort has been made to inform buyers of the risks they face. How One Houston Suburb Ended Up in a Reservoir Most residents whose homes flooded during Hurricane Harvey had no clue that their gated community was built in an area prone to such damage in extreme storms. March 22, 2018 In the beginning, it seemed like there was no need. County officials insisted that the developer warn prospective buyers that the homes lay in a flood reservoir, and Land Tejas agreed to do so, but only by way of an obscure filing. And yet the neighborhood is attractive in many ways. Canyon Gate, as its name suggests, offers a coveted sense of safety. It is also a remarkably cheap place to buy a home, and getting even cheaper. Before the storm and after, Canyon Gate stood out for its capacity for welcoming people from around the world, its cul-de-sacs home to Nigerians, Indians, Venezuelans and Canadians, along with people from dozens of other countries. Fort Bend County ranks among the most ethnically diverse places in the world. Metropolitan Houston already has a population of 6.6 million and it is projected to reach 14.2 million by 2050, according to the Texas Demographic Center. Video After Hurricane Harvey hit, these communities, built in what is called a flood pool, were sacrificed to save the city of Houston. We followed homeowners as they decided whether to cut their losses or rebuild, knowing it could happen again. The Disaster Economy Mr. Pelletiere, for his part, sees nothing wrong with buying flooded homes. He said he did not expect everyone to approve of what he was doing, but said that investing in such real estate depended on acquiring local knowledge and accurately measuring the value of a property. Even now, he said he refrained from informing buyers of his damaged homes of the flood risks, explaining that the law did not require him to do so. He was darting around his home, barking instructions to construction workers fixing the first floor. He dropped out of community college, he said, after realizing that higher education was not for him. Seeking opportunity, he lit out west for Southern California, where he met his wife, who works in the aviation software industry. Undaunted by his lack of a college degree, Mr. Pelletiere worked in corporate sales jobs, founded his cadaver-transport venture, and dabbled in real estate in San Diego, embracing the chance to use those skills when his wife was transferred to Houston. Image Mr. Pelletiere inspected a property for the first time that he purchased sight unseen in Canyon Gate. After the storm in August, Mr. Pelletiere joined a constellation of other speculators scrambling to buy flooded homes on the cheap. Canyon Gate scored well on nearly every measure, and Big State bought 13 homes in the neighborhood in the months after the hurricane. Mr. Spitz, a fourth-generation Texan with family roots in the pest control business, plunged into the post-disaster frenzy, snapping up 150 homes around Houston in the first 90 days after the storm. He said that some of the most alluring opportunities were found in areas with relatively low-priced properties before the storm, since homeowners in those neighborhoods sometimes lacked the financial resources to quickly rebuild.

A Canadian immigrant from British Columbia, she moved to Houston 13 years ago after living in Britain, Indonesia and France, countries where her husband worked for an oil services company. She said she was drawn to the community by its affordability and its access to open spaces. Research by climate scientists suggests that speculators of flooded homes will only see their market expand. The Environmental Protection Agency also acknowledges that flooding is growing much more frequent along the United States coastline, especially in Mid-Atlantic States where subsiding land and increases in relative sea level contribute to making floods 10 times more common in some areas than in the 1950s. Image James Smith, right, a real estate agent who deals in flooded homes. He acknowledged he is often the recipient of considerable negative energy from residents. One study showed that the seven-day rainfall from Harvey increased by at least 19 percent, and perhaps by as much as 38 percent, compared with similar storms in the mid-20th century, when the reservoirs designed to save the rest of Houston were built. Antonia Sebastian, a flood engineer at Rice University on the team of researchers that described how climate change made Hurricane Harvey more destructive, said she was as stunned as anyone to discover where Canyon Gate was built. For the speculators, the cycle of destruction presents a simpler proposition. James Smith, a fast-talking, cowboy-boot clad veteran of the Marines, moved to Houston from Florida after the 2008 housing crash. As a real estate agent who deals in flooded homes, he acknowledged he is often the recipient of considerable negative energy. Some of the residents in Canyon Gate questioning why he would do such work showed him the middle finger when he pulled up in his Mercedes S.U.V. Others simply looked away, as if his presence was a reminder of their ebbing fortunes. But none of that bothers him, he said. Check out a video, a graphic and story about the brutal choices made.

She and her neighbors were just beginning their grim reckoning with the damage. She tried to ignore the come-ons. His name was Nick Pelletiere, she learned. He ran a company that transported cadavers for funeral homes, but recently he had expanded into another lightly regulated trade: buying and selling flooded homes. Many parts of the city were hit hard by the hurricane, but Canyon Gate has the extraordinary distinction of being built within the confines of a reservoir specifically designed by the Army Corps of Engineers to protect central Houston from calamitous flooding. where some saw calamity, Mr. Pelletiere, a 47-year-old Chicagoan who followed his star to Houston two years ago, saw opportunity. buy he did. Within weeks, Mr. Pelletiere snapped up seven properties in areas hit by Harvey, all at a steep discount from their pre-storm values, pocketing sizable gains while some of his neighbors were grappling with financial ruin. Pelletiere laughed when he learned that his neighbors had taken to calling him Shady Nick. He said that the months since the storm had tested everyone. Those who are alive need to buy or sell their homes. has always drawn fortune seekers looking to make a quick buck. The city was founded in 1836 by two brothers from New York, John and Augustus Allen, who had immigrated to what was then northeast Mexico only to side with the pro-slavery separatists who led the Texas Revolution. But Houston, which is projected in about a decade to edge past Chicago as the third-largest city in the United States, has endured its own share of weather misfortune. Rains that year turned the streets of downtown Houston into choppy rivers, killing several people and shutting down the Port of Houston for eight months. Gate is designed to flood, but it is not part of the 100-year floodplain defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, so it is not covered by FEMA rules that require mortgage seekers in flood zones to buy flood insurance. the beginning, it seemed like there was no need. County officials insisted that the developer warn prospective buyers that the homes lay in a flood reservoir, and Land Tejas agreed to do so, but only by way of an obscure filing. yet the neighborhood is attractive in many ways. Canyon Gate, as its name suggests, offers a coveted sense of safety. It is also a remarkably cheap place to buy a home, and getting even cheaper. the storm and after, Canyon Gate stood out for its capacity for welcoming people from around the world, its cul-de-sacs home to Nigerians, Indians, Venezuelans and Canadians, along with people from dozens of other countries. Fort Bend County ranks among the most ethnically diverse places in the world. Hurricane Harvey hit, these communities, built in what is called a flood pool, were sacrificed to save the city of Houston. Houston sprawls over the prairies, its residents are reckoning with the likelihood that the city will flood time and again in the decades ahead. Pelletiere, for his part, sees nothing wrong with buying flooded homes. He said he did not expect everyone to approve of what he was doing, but said that investing in such real estate depended on acquiring local knowledge and accurately measuring the value of a property. opportunity, he lit out west for Southern California, where he met his wife, who works in the aviation software industry. the storm in August, Mr. Pelletiere joined a constellation of other speculators scrambling to buy flooded homes on the cheap. Spitz, a fourth-generation Texan with family roots in the pest control business, plunged into the post-disaster frenzy, snapping up 150 homes around Houston in the first 90 days after the storm. A Canadian immigrant from British Columbia, she moved to Houston 13 years ago after living in Britain, Indonesia and France, countries where her husband worked for an oil services company. She said she was drawn to the community by its affordability and its access to open spaces. by climate scientists suggests that speculators of flooded homes will only see their market expand. Smith, right, a real estate agent who deals in flooded homes. not only made Hurricane Harvey more destructive, but is also tripling the chances of further extreme rainfall along the Gulf Coast, according to studies presented at a recent meeting of the American Geophysical Union. Sebastian, a flood engineer at Rice University on the team of researchers that described how climate change made Hurricane Harvey more destructive, said she was as stunned as anyone to discover where Canyon Gate was built. the speculators, the cycle of destruction presents a simpler proposition. James Smith, a fast-talking, cowboy-boot clad veteran of the Marines, moved to Houston from Florida after the 2008 housing crash. none of that bothers him, he said. State officials estimate that nearly 100,000 residences suffered damage from Hurricane Harvey. Harris County says it will take that damage into account when assessing property values that will be used to apply property taxes for 2018. Jack Barnett is with the Harris County Appraisal District. He says damaged properties will be appraised on their values post Harvey for next year. As always, a property owner can contest the value placed on a home or business, which leads to a review board to determine property value. Barnett says. HCAD recommends people have photos and documentation to support any dispute of appraisal values. In 2017, about one-in-four appraisals were protested. A year later, she and her family continue to help Rockport rebuild, while the port continues to fine-tune its emergency preparedness plans. We recap what's at stake on Primary Election Day. We discuss school safety in Greater Houston. And Stephanie Wittels Wachs talks about her new memoir. Mary Ann Constantinou is a cool customer. Born in New Orleans, she prepped her never-flooded Houston house long before Hurricane Harvey swamped her neighborhood. When water seeped through the floorboards, she located a rescue boat and got her husband, teenaged son, elderly neighbor and basset hound to safety. Harvey may have deluged her with challenges, but she weathered them all. All over Houston, people are complaining of an odd forgetfulness. Highways may be clear, deadlines met, and the city mostly back to business. But storm survivors and even residents all but untouched by the downpour now find themselves muddling dates, weeping at small frustrations or vexed by insomnia. But in the immediate aftermath of stressful events such as Harvey and other global disasters this year, many others will feel some form of time distortion or emotional and physical unease. Like many post-Harvey Texans, she now wakes up laser-focused on mucking out and rebuilding her destroyed home. Yet at a recent PTA function, she kept reintroducing herself to people she already knew. In plain English, Wettergreen started seeing time as fluid, only meaningful as far as what needed to be done. As an engineer, he is ordinarily fixated on dates, appointments, and measurements. But in the wake of the hurricane, when he ran software linking food providers to rescue groups, Wettergreen routinely called colleagues at midnight without apologizing. Punctuating that eerie remove, for many people, are jagged, intrusive memories. Some remember looking out the window and seeing a familiar street become a disaster site with boats, megaphones and sobbing neighbors. Others have sensory flashbacks, like the feel of oily, foul-smelling water as they swam or trudged to safety. And many feel a surge of panic during the regular rainfalls common in a wet city like Houston. In Houston, you have so many people who were disaster survivors already. The next phase On occasion that can lead to full-fledged PTSD. But what more Houstonians will experience is the normal next phase of acute stress: irritability, melancholy, a general malaise.

In the Fifth Ward, home to many low-income residents, life already could be overwhelming before the flooding, peer counselor Julia Walker says. So as soon as she saw that recovery groups were delivering water and food, she began one-on-one counseling amid the piles of debris crowding the streets. Debris piles up in front of flooded Habitat homes in Houston, after Harvey. October 2017. Many storm survivors need professional, stage-by-stage mental health care, something already in short supply before Harvey. In its absence, ordinary Houstonians can help. If you know someone who was flooded, counselors say, listen to them. Friends and acquaintances can make a difference by inviting recent survivors to say as much as they want to about their experience. But it feels like we have been forgotten. When the creature attacked her, piercing a vein, Constantinou swathed her arm in a towel, grabbed the angry bird and got them both to a rescue boat. At a recent visit to pick up contact lenses, Constantinou learned that her long-distance vision had worsened so much in just the few weeks since the flooding that she needed a new prescription. Hurricane Harvey, the eye doctor said, had played havoc with her ability to see far ahead. We learn more about the safety concerns at the Arkema chemical plant in Crosby. Greater Houston has, of course, many chemical plants and an enormous petrochemical industry. The Harris County Commissioners Court approved Tuesday the buyout of several Houston homes that flooded before Harvey. The homes are located in neighborhoods such as Braeburn Glen, Langwood and Cashiola. For Judge Ed Emmett, the next big question is determining how many homes should be bought out based on the flooding Harvey caused. The Commissioners also approved appraising 41 properties located in Harris County, which will be bought out using funds from a FEMA grant. These properties also suffered flooding before Harvey.
